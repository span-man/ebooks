的色萨利之间矗立着一座高山。大雾弥漫的山顶直插云霄。山顶上，众神们的家
园沐浴在阳光之中。宙斯作为山神和人类之父主宰着那里的一切。总的说来，宙
斯并不是一个独裁统治者。但毫无疑问，凡事山神们都要听从他的命令。宙斯将
男女山神12人组成一个委员会，宙斯本人则坐第一把交椅，是众神与人类的太上
皇，也是雷电的操纵者。他旁边是他那傲慢且嫉妒的皇后赫拉。波塞冬是大海的
统治者。哈得斯是主宰阴间的冥王，他在委员会中没有席位。阿波罗是太阳神、
音乐和诗神。他的孪生姐妹阿耳特弥斯是月亮和狩猎女神。雅典娜是智慧女神和
家居艺术品的守护女神。赫提斯是家室之神，象征着家庭中的生命与幸福。气势
汹汹的阿瑞斯是战神。媚人的阿芙罗狄蒂是爱与美神。火神赫菲斯托斯是宙斯雷
电的创造者。以翅代步的信使海尔墨斯掌管商业与发明事务。谷物与丰收女神得
墨特尔负责管理农业，她是文明之母。以上所提到的主要天神们都假装成凡人的
样子，他们的美丽与魅力无可匹敌。因常受到凡人情感与愿望的感染，他们不时
地勃然大怒，妒嫉别人。他们卷入与人类世界无休止的争斗中。在奥林波斯，他
们之间也充满了阴谋与权力之争。在凡人的世界里，他们经历了敌对与挫折。他
们珍惜人间的爱与友善。这群长生不老的天神们的外表与行为完全符合人间的方
式。这就是奥林波斯山神们的本来面目。

coat and hermes gave her the power of telling lies.a charming young lady，
she was the first woman that ever lived.zeus called her pandora.because
she had received from each of the gods and goddesses a gift.the gift was
harmful to men. zeus decided to send her down to men as a present.so hermes
them essenger brought her to epimetheus ，brother of prometheus.the greatness
of her beauty touched the hearts of all who looked upon her ，and epimetheus
happily received her into his house.he had quite forgotten pometheus'
warning ：never to accept anything from zeus.the couple lived a happy
life for some time.then trouble came on to the human world. when he was
busy with teaching men the art of living，prometheus had left a bigcask
in the care of epimetheus.he had warned his brother not to open the lid.pandora

war ，plague and sickness ，theft and violence， grief sorrow ，and all
the other evils.the human world was hence to experience these evils.only

俱增。一天，他令儿子赫菲斯托斯用泥塑一美女像，并请众神赠予她不同的礼物。

    其中，雅典娜饰之以华丽的衣裳，赫耳墨斯赠之以说谎的能力。世上的第一
个女人是位迷人女郎，因为她从每位神灵那里得到了一样对男人有害的礼物，因
此宙斯称她为潘多拉（pander：意为煽动）。宙斯决定把她作为礼物送给世间的
男子。

    于是信使赫耳墨斯将她带给普罗米修斯的弟弟厄庇墨透斯。她姿容绝美，见
者无不为之倾心。厄庇墨透斯兴高采烈地把她迎入屋内。普罗米修斯警告过他不
得接受宙斯的任何馈赠，而他已将之忘于脑后。这一对夫妻有过一段幸福的生活，
但不久灾难却降临人间。当普罗米修斯忙于教授人们生存之道的时候，他把一个
桶托付给厄庇墨透斯。他警告过他的弟弟不要打开桶盖。潘多拉好奇心强。她的
丈夫不允许她看桶中之物，这使她感到十分懊恼。一天乘厄庇墨透斯出门在外，
她打开桶盖，从桶里跑出的是不和与战争，瘟疫与疾病，偷窃与暴力，悲哀与忧
虑，以及其他一些人类从此要遭受的不幸。只有希望被关在桶口，永远飞不出来，
因此人们常常把希望藏于心中。

阿波罗在众多的奥林波斯山神中，主神宙斯和雷托之子阿波罗最受推崇。据希腊
神话记载，雷托被天后赫拉驱赶得四处流浪。最终是海神波塞冬怜悯她并从海中
捞起提落岛让她居住。在岛上，她生了孪生儿子阿波罗和阿尔特弥斯。阿波罗是
太阳神。清晨他身着紫色袍，坐在那明亮的东方宫殿，准备开始每日穿越天空的
旅行。白天，他驾着用金子和象牙制成的战车，给广阔无垠的大地带来光明、生
命和仁爱。黄昏时分，他在遥远的西海结束了旅行，然后就乘上金船返回东方的
家中。阿波罗是音乐神和诗神。他可唤起人们倾注于圣歌中的各种情感。在奥林
波斯山上，他手拿金质里拉，用悦耳的音调指挥缪斯的合唱。当他帮助波塞冬建
造特洛伊城墙时，里拉奏出的音乐如此动听，以致石头有节奏地、自动地各就其
位。有一次他接受凡人音乐家马斯亚斯的挑战参加一次竞赛。战胜对方后，他将
对手剥皮致死以惩罚他的狂妄自大。在另外一次音乐比赛中，因输给了潘神，他
就将裁判迈尔斯国王的耳朵变成了驴耳朵。阿波罗的儿子俄耳甫斯继承了父亲这
方面的才能。他的竖琴使人与动物皆受感动。阿波罗象征着青春和男子汉的美。

    金色的头发、庄重的举止、容光焕发的神态，这些足以使他受到世人的青睐。
一位名叫克里提的美丽少女迷恋于他的英俊潇洒，跪在地上，从黎明到黄昏，双
手伸向太阳神。她凝视着那辆金质马车在蔚蓝的天空驰骋。虽然她的爱并未得到
回报，但她对阿波罗的痴情却从未改变。目睹这悲哀的场面，众神深受感动，将
她变成了一株向日葵。

    Prometheus prometheus was a titan .in the war between zeus the giants
he had stood on the side of the new olympiangods.out of the clay he made
the first man ，to whom athena gave soul and holy breath.prometheus spent
a lot of time and energy in creating the gift of fire.and fire raised
man above all animals .later，there held a joint meeting of gods and men.the
meeting was to decide what part of burnt animals should begiven to gods
and what to men.prometheus cut up an ox and divided it into two parts
：under the skin he placed the fresh，and under the fat he put the bones，
for he knew the selfish zeus loved fat. zeus saw through the trick and
felt displeased at the prometheus' favor towards men.so in a masterful
way he took away the gift of fire from mankind.however，prometheus managed
to steal fire from heaven and secretly brought it down tomen.flying into
an anger at this unjustified act of rebellion ，zeus let the other gods
chain prometheus to a rock on mountain caucasus ，where a hungry eagle
ever tore at his liver which ever grew again.his period of pain was to
be thirty-thousand years.prometheus faced his bitter fate firmly and never
lost courage before zeus.at last heracles made prometheus and zeus restore
to friend ship，when heracles came over in search of the golden apple
and killed the eagle and set the friend of mankind free.普罗米修斯普罗
米修斯是泰坦巨人之一。在宙斯与巨人的战争中，他站在新的奥林波斯山神一边。

    他用粘土造出了第一个男人。雅典娜赋予了这个男人灵魂和神圣的生命。普
罗米修斯还花费了很多时间和精力创造了火，并将之赠予人类。火使人成为万物
之灵。

    在这之后，举行了第一次神与人的联席会议。这个会议将决定烧烤过的动物
的哪一部分该分给神，哪一部分该给人类。普罗米修斯切开一头牛，把它分成两
部分：他把肉放在皮下，将骨头放在肥肉下。因为他知道自私的宙斯爱吃肥肉。
宙斯看穿了他的把戏。普罗米修斯偏袒人类，这使宙斯感到不快。因此，他专横
地把火从人类手中夺走。然而，普罗米修斯设法窃走了天火，偷偷地把它带给人
类。

    宙斯对他这种肆无忌惮的违抗行为大发雷霆。他令其他的山神把普罗米修斯
用锁链缚在高加索山脉的一块岩石上。一只饥饿的老鹰天天来啄食他的肝脏，而
他的肝脏又总是重新长出来。他的痛苦要持续三万年。而他坚定地面对苦难，从
来不在宙斯面前丧失勇气。最后，海格立斯使普罗米修斯与宙斯恢复了他们的友
谊，找到了金苹果，杀死了老鹰，因而解救了人类的老朋友。

孩。杰森是位王子，他的父亲埃宋曾是伊俄卡斯的国王，但后来王位却被他同父
异母兄弟珀利阿斯夺去了。因此他把还在襁褓中的儿子送给centaur 照料。还是
个孩子时，杰森就参加过捕猎野猪。当他长成一位强壮的小伙，知道自己身世的
秘密后，他决定要为父亲所受的不公报仇雪恨。在返回祖国的路上，他遇到一位
老婆婆。她希望能有人帮她渡过山里的一条小溪。出于善良的天性和谦恭有礼的
本能，杰森背起老人，淌过了小溪。他并未想到这位老婆婆竟是赫拉本人。因此
他在生活的起点便得到了一位神通广大的朋友的帮助和保护。由于他在过河时遗
失了一只鞋子，他不得不赤着一只脚走进了珀利阿斯的宫殿。当珀利阿斯看到这

kronus sat on thethrone.generous nature met all the needs of men .there

yet made to open.men lived a happy life.they were forever young.they were
always eating richly and knew neither hard labour nor sorrow.when death
came it came like apeaceful sleep.and they became good spirits in heaven。
the silver age was one in which the human race was somewhat less valuable
in body and mind.the period was of helpless be ginning.it lasted a hundred
years.and it was the time of manhood，short and troubled.men spent in
ignorance and evil.they no longer admired the gods and offered no sacrifices.however，

had some honour and lived on as spirits under the earth. during the age
of bronze men became further degenerated .dressed in bronze and armed
with weapons of bronze，they live din the houses of bronze.cruel and heartless，
they delighted inwar and died in endless struggle.when they passed away
，they came into the darkness of the lower world. the last age ，that of
iron，was one of continual care and grief.there was no family love，no

烧死。宙斯为此勃然大怒。惊恐的伊克西翁跑到天堂，苦苦哀求众神和众人之父
宽恕他的不诚实。他的请求得到了准许，于是他兴高采烈地在这辉煌璀璨的神的

魂颠倒。他忘记了家里的黛。他盘算着要让赫位与他一道私奔。看到这些，宙斯
把一朵赫拉形状的云送到了伊克西翁跟前。这位不虔诚的国王和这朵云做爱，并
使她生下了半人半马的怪物。怒不可遏的宙斯把伊克西翁打下了地狱，将他绑在
一个不停旋转的火轮上，这急速旋转的火轮永远折磨、撕扯着他的躯体。

回声和那西塞斯那西塞斯是一位英俊的青年，面容可爱，体形优美。他深信，他
的容貌会使每个见到他的人羡慕不已。他很骄傲，认为除了自己之外，别人都不
配欣赏他那充满青春气息的面庞。因而，他沉溺于甜美的自我欣赏之中，远离所
有的人，在苍翠蓊郁的小山谷中终日闲逛，他成了一位自恋狂。一天，那西塞斯
在树林中愉快地游荡。一位名叫回声的仙女一看见他就兴奋起来；她伸出爱的双
臂，高兴地走向那西塞斯。然而，令她惊愕的是，这位青年粗暴地将她推开，连
看都不看她一眼就走开了。这位可怜的仙女羞红了脸，迅速退到遮阴处，含情脉
脉地凝望着心上人。不久，那西塞斯来到一条小溪边饮水。当他跪在岸边时，他
发现清澈的溪水中有一张非常可爱的面庞。他非常激动，并对着水中的人微笑，
水中人也给了他一个微笑。他认为，一定是一位仙女爱上了他。于是，他就蹲下
去吻她，她的嘴唇也向他靠拢。但是，当他的嘴唇一接触清澈的溪水，水中那张
可爱的脸就消失了。这位恼怒的青年人此时变得绝望了，他从未被人如此鄙视过。

    他日夜呆在溪边，不吃不喝，不久就死了。他从未怀疑过水中的女子只是自
己的影子罢了。众神非常怜悯他那优美的躯体，把他变成了一朵同名的花。那位
陶醉于爱河的回声亲眼目睹了这一切变化。慢慢地，她由于单相思而日渐憔悴；
最后，除了声音之外，她已经一无所有。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事1 ：普罗米修斯

    施瓦布

    天和地被创造出来，大海波浪起伏，拍击海岸。鱼儿在水里嬉戏，鸟儿在空
中歌唱。大地上动物成群，但还没有一个具有灵魂的、能够主宰周围世界的高级
生物。这时普罗米修斯降生了，他是被宙斯放逐的古老的神}族的后裔，是地母
该亚与乌拉诺斯所生的伊阿佩托斯的儿子。他聪慧而睿智，知道天神的种子蕴藏
在泥土中，于是他捧起泥土，用河水把它沾湿调和起来，按照世界的主宰，即天
神的模样，捏成人形。为了给这泥人以生命，他从动物的灵魂中摄取了善与恶两
种性格，将它们封进人的胸膛里。在天神中，他有一个女友，即智慧女神雅典娜
；她惊叹这提坦神之子的创造物，于是便朝具有一半灵魂的泥人吹起了神气，使
它获得了灵性。　　这样，第一批人在世上出现了，他们繁衍生息，不久形成了
一大群，遍布各处。但有很长一段时间，他们不知道该怎样使用他们的四肢，也
不知道该怎样使用神赐的灵魂。他们视而不见，听而不闻，如同梦中的人形，漫
无目的地走来走去，却不知道发挥自身的作用。他们不知道采石，烧砖，砍伐林
木制成椽梁，然后再用这些材料建造房屋。他们如同蚂蚁一样，蛰居在没有阳光
的土洞里，觉察不了冬去春来夏至；他们做样样事情都毫无计划。　　于是，普
罗米修斯便来帮助他的创造物。他教会他们观察日月星辰的升起和降落；给他们
发明了数字和文字，让他们懂得计算和用文字交换思想；他还教他们驾驭牲口，
来分担他们的劳动，使他们懂得给马套上缰绳拉车或作为坐骑。他发明了船和帆，
让他们在海上航行。他关心人类生活中其他的一切活动。从前，生病的人不知道
用药物治病，不知道涂药膏或服药来减轻痛苦，许多病人因缺医少药而悲惨地死
去。现在，普罗米修斯教会他们调制药剂来防治各种疾病。另外，他教会他们占
卜，圆梦，解释鸟的飞翔和祭祀显示的各种征兆。他引导他们勘探地下的矿产，
让他们发现矿石，开采铁和金银。他教会他们农耕技艺，使他们生活得更舒适。

    不久前，宙斯放逐了他的父亲克洛诺斯，推翻了古老的神}族，普罗米修斯
也出身于这个神}族。现在，宙斯和他的儿子们是天上新的主宰，他们开始注意
到刚刚形成的人类了。他们要求人类敬重他们，并以此作为保护人类的条件。有
一天，在希腊的墨科涅，神}们集会商谈，确定人类的权利和义务。普罗米修斯
作为人类的维护者出席了会议。在会上，他设法使诸神不要因为答应保护人类而
提出苛刻的献祭条件。这位提坦神的儿子决意运用他的智慧来蒙骗神}. 他代表
他的创造物宰了一头大公牛，请神}选择他们喜欢的那部分。他把献祭的公牛切
成碎块，分为两堆。一堆放上肉、内脏和脂肪，用牛皮遮盖起来，上面放着牛肚
子；另一堆放的全是牛骨头，巧妙地用牛的板油包裹起来。这一堆比另一堆大一
些。全知全能的神}之父宙斯看穿了他在玩弄伎俩，便说：" 伊阿佩托斯的儿子，
尊贵的王，我的好朋友，你把祭品分得多不公平啊！" 这时，普罗米修斯越发相
信他骗过了宙斯，于是暗自笑着说：" 尊贵的宙斯，永恒的众神之祖，你就按自
己的心愿挑选一堆吧！" 宙斯心里很气恼，却故意伸出双手去拿雪白的板油。当
他剥掉板油，看清这全是剔光的骨头时，装着直到现在才发觉上当似的，气愤地
说：" 我看到了，伊阿佩托斯的儿子，你还没有忘掉你欺骗的伎俩！" 　　宙斯
受了欺骗，决定报复普罗米修斯。他拒绝向人类提供生活必需的最后一样东西：
火。可是伊阿佩托斯的儿子非常机敏，马上想出了巧妙的办法。他拿来一根又粗
又长的茴香秆，扛着它走近驰来的太阳车，将茴香秆伸到它的火焰里点燃，然后
带着闪烁的火种回到地上，很快第一堆木柴燃烧起来，火越烧越旺，烈焰冲天。

    宙斯见人间升起了火焰，大发雷霆，他眼看已无法把火从人类那儿夺走了，
便很快想出了新的灾难来惩罚人类，以便抵消火带给人类的福社。他命令以工艺
著名的火神赫淮斯托斯造了一尊美女石像。雅典娜由于渐渐妒嫉普罗米修斯，也
对他失去了好意，她亲自给石像披上了闪亮的白衣裳，蒙上了面纱，头上戴上了
花环，束上了金发带。这金发带也是出自赫淮斯托斯之手。他为了取悦他父亲，
细心制作，金发带造形精巧，带上饰有神态各异的动物形象。众神的使者赫耳墨
斯给这妩媚迷人的形体传授语言的技能；爱神阿佛洛狄忒赋予她种种诱人的魅力。
于是宙斯给这美丽的形象注入了恶毒的祸水，他给她取名为潘多拉，意为" 具有
一切天赋的女人" ，因为众神都馈赠给她一件危害人类的礼物。他把这个年轻的
女人送到人间，正在地上自在取乐游荡的众神见了这美得无法比拟的女人都惊羡
不已。

    她径自来到普罗米修斯的弟弟埃庇米修斯的面前，请他收下宙斯给他的赠礼。
埃庇米修斯心地善良，毫无猜疑。　　普罗米修斯曾经警告过他的弟弟，不要接
受奥林匹斯山上的宙斯的任何赠礼，而要立即把它退回去。可是，埃庇米修斯忘
记了这个警告，很高兴地接纳了这个年轻美貌的女人。直到后来，他吃了苦头，
才意识到他招来了灾祸。在此之前，人类遵照普罗米修斯的警告，因此没有灾祸，
没有艰辛的劳动，也没有折磨人的疾病。现在，这个姑娘双手捧上礼物，这是一
只紧闭的大盒子。她一走到埃庇米修斯的面前，就突然打开了盒盖，里面的灾害
像股黑烟似地飞了出来，迅速地扩散到地上。盒子底上还深藏着唯一美好的东西
：希望，但潘多拉依照万神之父的告诫，趁它还没有飞出来的时候，赶紧关上了
盖子，因此希望就永远关在盒内了。从此，各种各样的灾难充满了大地、天空和
海洋。疾病日日夜夜在人类中蔓延，肆虐，而又悄无声息，因为宙斯不让它们发
出声响。各种热病在大地上猖獗，死神步履如飞地在人间狂奔。接着，宙斯向普
罗米修斯本人报复了。他把这名仇敌交到赫淮斯托斯和两名仆人的手里，这两名
仆人外号叫做克拉托斯和皮亚，即强力和暴力。他们把普罗米修斯拖到斯库提亚
的荒山野岭。在这里，他被牢固的铁链锁在高加索山的悬岩上，下临可怕的深渊。

    赫淮斯托斯不太情愿执行父亲的命令，因为他很喜欢这位提坦神的儿子，他
是他的亲戚，同辈，是他的曾祖父乌拉诺斯的子孙，也是神}的后裔。可是，执
行残酷命令的两个粗暴的仆人，因他说了许多同情的话，把他痛斥了一顿。普罗
米修斯被迫锁在悬岩绝壁上，他给直挺挺地吊着，无法入睡，无法弯曲一下疲惫
的双膝。" 不管你发出多少哀诉和悲叹，都是无济于事的，" 赫淮斯托斯对他说，
" 因为宙斯的意志是不可动摇的，这些最近才从别人手里夺得权力的神}们都是
非常狠心的。" 这位囚徒被判受折磨是永久的，至少也得三万年。尽管他大声悲
叫，并且呼唤风儿、河川、大海和万物之母大地，以及注视万物的太阳来为他的
苦痛作证，但是他的精神却是坚不可摧的。" 无论谁，只要他学会承认定数的不
可制服的威力，" 他说，" 就必须承受命中注定的痛苦。" 宙斯再三威逼他，要
他说明他的不吉祥的预言，即" 一种新的婚姻将使诸神之王面临毁灭" ，①但他
始终没有开口。宙斯言出必行，每天派一只恶鹰去啄食被缚的普罗米修斯的肝脏。
肝脏被吃掉多少，很快又恢复原状。这种痛苦的折磨他不得不忍受，直到将来有
人自愿为他献身为止。　　①指跟海洋女神忒提斯的婚姻。其子威力超过父亲。

    为不幸的普罗米修斯解除苦难的一天终于来到了。在他被吊在悬岩上，度过
了漫长的悲惨岁月以后，有一天，赫拉克勒斯为寻找赫斯珀里得斯来到这里。他
看到恶鹰在啄食可怜的普罗米修斯的肝脏，这时，便取出弓箭，把那只残忍的恶
鹰从这位苦难者的肝脏旁一箭射落。然后他松开锁链，解放了普罗米修斯，带他
离开了山崖。但为了满足宙斯的条件，赫拉克勒斯把半人半马的肯陶洛斯族的喀
戎作为替身留在悬崖上。喀戎虽然可以要求永生，但为了解救普罗米修斯，他甘
愿献出自己的生命。为了彻底执行宙斯的判决，普罗米修斯必须永远戴一只铁环，
环上镶上一块高加索山上的石子。这样，宙斯可以自豪地宣称，他的仇敌仍然被
锁在高加索山的悬崖上。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事2 ：人类的时代

    施瓦布

    神}创造的第一代人类乃是黄金的一代。那时候统治天国的是克洛诺斯（即
萨图恩）。这代人生活得如同神}一样，他们无忧无虑，没有繁重的劳动，也没
有苦恼和贫困。大地给他们提供了各种各样的硕果，丰盛的草地上牛羊成群，他
们平和地从事劳动，几乎不会衰老。当他们感到死期来临的时候，便沉入安详的
长眠之中。当命运之神判定黄金的一代人从地上消失时，他们都成为仁慈的保护
神，在云雾中来来去去，他们是一切善举的施主，维护法律和正义，惩罚一切罪
恶。　　后来神}用白银创造了第二代人类。他们在外貌和精神上都与第一代人
类不同。娇生惯养的孩子生活在家中，受到母亲的溺爱和照料。他们百年都保持
着童年，精神上不成熟。等到孩子步入壮年时，他们的一生只剩下短短的几年了。

    放肆的行为使这代人陷入苦难的深渊，因为他们无法节制他们的激烈的感情。
他们尔虞我诈，肆无忌惮地违法乱纪，不再给神}献祭。宙斯十分恼怒，要把这
个种族从地上消灭，因为他不愿意看到有人亵渎神}. 当然，这个种族也不是一
无是处，所以他们荣幸地获得恩准，在终止生命以后，可以作为魔鬼在地上漫游。

    天父宙斯创造了第三代人类。即青铜的人类。这代人跟白银时代的人又完全
不同。他们残忍而粗暴，只知道战争，总是互相厮杀。每个人都要千方百计地侮
辱其他人。他们专吃动物的肉，不愿食用田野上的各种果实。他们顽固的意志如
同金刚石一样坚硬，人也长得异常高大壮实。他们使用的是青铜武器，住的是青
铜房屋，用青铜农具耕种田地，因为那时还没有铁。他们不断进行战争，可是，
虽然他们长得高大可怕，然而却无法抗拒死亡。他们离开晴朗而光明的大地之后，
便降入阴森可怕的冥府之中。　　当这代人也降入地府时，宙斯又创造了第四代
人。这代人应该住在肥沃的大地上，他们比以前的人类更高尚，更公正。他们是
神}英雄的一代人，即古代所称的半神的英雄们。可是最后他们也陷入战争和仇
杀中，有的为了夺取俄狄甫斯国王的国土，倒在底比斯的七道城门前；有的为了
美丽的海伦跨上战船，倒在特洛伊的田野上。当他们在战争和灾难中结束了在地
上的生存后，宙斯把他们送往极乐岛，让他们居住和生活在那里。极乐岛在天边
的大海里，风景优美。他们过着宁静而幸福的生活，富饶的大地每年三次给他们
提供甜蜜的果实。　　古代诗人希西阿说到世世代代的人类传说时，慨叹道："
唉，如果我不生在现今人类的第五代的话，如果我早一点去世或迟一点出生的话，
那该多好啊！因为这代人是黑铁制成的！他们彻底堕落，彻底败坏，充满着痛苦
和罪孽；他们日日夜夜地忧虑和苦恼，不得安宁。神}不断地给他们增添新的烦
恼，而最大的烦恼却是他们自身带来的。父亲反对儿子，儿子敌视父亲，客人憎
恨款待他的朋友，朋友之间也互相憎恨。人间充满着怨仇，即使兄弟之间也不像
从前那样袒诚相见，充满仁爱。白发苍苍的父母得不到怜悯和尊敬。老人备受虐
待。啊，无情的人类啊，你们怎么忘了神}将要给予的裁判，全然不顾父母的养
育之恩？处处都是强权者得势，欺诈者横行无忌，他们心里恶毒地盘算着如何去
毁灭对方的城市和村庄。正直、善良和公正的人被践踏；拐骗者飞黄腾达，备受
光荣。权利和克制不再受到敬重。恶人侮辱善人，他们说谎话，用诽谤和诋毁制
造事端。实际上，这就是这些人如此不幸的原因。从前至善和尊严女神还常来地
上，如今也悲哀地用白衣裹住美丽的身躯，离开了人间，回到永恒的神}世界。

    这时候，留给人类的只是绝望和痛苦，没有任何的希望。"

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事3 ：丢卡利翁和皮拉

    施瓦布

    在青铜人类的时代，世界的主宰宙斯不断地听到这代人的恶行，他决定扮作
凡人降临到人间去查看。他来到地上后，发现情况比传说中的还要严重得多。一
天，快要深夜时，他走进阿耳卡狄亚国王吕卡翁的大厅里，吕卡翁不仅待客冷淡，
而且残暴成性。宙斯以神奇的先兆，表明自己是个神。人们都跪下来向他顶礼膜
拜。但吕卡翁却不以为然，嘲笑他们虔诚的祈祷。" 让我们考证一下，" 他说，
" 看看他到底是凡人还是神}！" 于是，他暗自决定趁着来客半夜熟睡的时候将
他杀害。在这之前他首先悄悄地杀了一名人质，这是摩罗西亚人送来的可怜人。

    吕卡翁让人剁下他的四肢，然后扔在滚开的水里煮，其余部分放在火上烤，
以此作为晚餐献给陌生的客人。宙斯把这一切都看在眼里，他被激怒了，从餐桌
上跳起来，唤来一团复仇的怒火，投放在这个不仁不义的国王的宫院里。国王惊
恐万分，想逃到宫外去。可是，他发出的第一声呼喊就变成了凄厉的嚎叫；他身
上的皮肤变成粗糙多毛的皮；双臂支到地上，变成了两条前腿。从此吕卡翁成了
一只嗜血成性的恶狼。　　宙斯回到奥林匹斯圣出。他与诸神商量，决定根除这
一代可耻的人。他正想用闪电惩罚整个大地，但又担心天国会被殃及，宇宙之轴
会被烧毁。于是，他放弃了这种粗暴报复的念头，放下独眼神给他炼铸的雷电锤，
决定向地下降下暴雨，用洪水灭绝人类。这时，除了南风，所有的风都被锁在埃
俄罗斯的岩洞里。南风接受了命令，扇动着湿漉漉的翅膀直扑地面。南风可怕的
脸黑得犹如锅底，胡须沉甸甸的，好像满天乌云。洪涛流自他的白发，雾霭遮盖
着前额，大水从他的胸脯涌出。南风升在空中，用手紧紧地抓住浓云，狠狠地挤
压。

    顿时，雷声隆隆，大雨如注。暴风雨摧残了地里的庄稼。农民的希望破灭了，
整整一年的辛劳都白费了。　　宙斯的弟弟，海神波塞冬也不甘寂寞，急忙赶来
帮着破坏，他把所有的河流都召集起来，说：" 你们应该掀起狂澜，吞没房屋，
冲垮堤坝！" 他们都听从他的命令。波塞冬亲自上阵，手执三叉神戟，撞击大地，
为洪水开路。河水汹涌澎河，势不可挡。泛滥的洪水涌上田野，犹如狂暴的野兽，
冲倒大衬、庙宇和房屋。水势不断上涨，不久便淹没了宫殿，连教堂的塔尖也卷
入湍急的漩涡中。顷刻间，水陆莫辨，整个大地一片汪洋，无边无际。　　人类
面对滔滔的洪水，绝望地寻找救命的办法。有的爬上山顶，有的驾起木船，航行
在淹没的房顶上。大水一直漫过了葡萄园，船底扫过了葡萄架。鱼儿在枝蔓间挣
扎，满山遍野逃遁的野猪被浪涛吞没，淹死。一群群人都被洪水冲走，幸免于难
的人后来也饿死在光秃秃的山顶上。在福喀斯，有一座高山的两个山峰露出水面，
这就是帕耳那索斯山。普罗米修斯的儿子丢卡利翁事先得到父亲的警告，造了一
条大船。当洪水到来时，他和妻子皮拉驾船驶往帕耳那索斯。被创造的男人和女
人再也没有比他们更善良，更虔诚的了。宙斯召唤大水淹没大地，报复了人类。

    他从天上俯视人间，看到千千万万的人中只剩下一对可怜的人，漂在水面上，
这对夫妇善良而信仰神}. 宙斯平熄了怒火。他唤来北风，北风驱散了团团乌云
和浓浓的雾霭，让天空重见光明。掌管海洋的波塞冬见状也放下三叉戟，使滚滚
的海涛退去，海水驯服地退到高高的堤岸下，河水也回到了河床。树梢从深水中
露了出来，树叶上沾满污泥。群山重现，平原伸展，大地复原。　　丢卡利翁看
看周围，大地荒芜，一片泥泞，如同坟墓一样死寂。看着这一切，他禁不住淌下
了眼泪，对妻子皮拉说：" 亲爱的，我朝远处眺望，后不到一个活人。我们两个
人是大地上仅存的人类，其他人都被洪水吞没了，可是，我们也很难生存下去。
我看到的每一朵云彩都使我惊恐。即使一切危险都过去了，我们两个孤单的人在
这荒凉的世界上，又能做什么呢？唉，要是我的父亲普罗米修斯教会我创造人类
的本领，教会我把灵魂给予泥人的技术，那该多么好啊！" 妻子听他说完，也很
悲伤，两个人不禁痛哭起来。他们没有了主意，只好来到半荒废的圣坛前跪下，
向女神忒弥斯恳求说：" 女神啊，请告诉我们，该如何创造已经灭亡了的一代人
类。

    啊，帮助沉沦的世界再生吧！" 　　" 离开我的圣坛，" 女神的声音回答说，
" 戴上面纱，解开腰带，然后把你们母亲的骸骨仍到你们的身后去！" 　　两个
人听了这神秘的言语，十分惊讶，莫明其妙。皮拉首先打破了沉默，说：" 高贵
的女神，宽恕我吧。我不得不违背你的意愿，因为我不能扔掉母亲的遗骸，不想
冒犯她的阴魂！" 　　但丢卡利翁的心里却豁然明朗，他顿时领悟了，于是好言
抚慰妻子说：" 如果我的理解没有错，那么女神的命令并没有叫我们干不敬的事。

    大地是我们仁慈的母亲，石块一定是她的骸骨。皮拉，我们应该把石块扔到
身后去！" 　　话虽这么说，但两个人还是将信将疑，他们想不妨尝试一下。于
是，他们转过身子，蒙住头，再松开衣带，然后按照女神的命令，把石块朝身后
扔去。

    一种奇迹出现了：石头突然不再坚硬、松脆，而是变得柔软，巨大，逐渐成
形。

    人的模样开始显现出来，可是还没有完全成型，好像艺术家刚从大理石雕凿
出来的粗略的轮廓。石头上湿润的泥土变成了一块块肌肉，结实坚硬的石头变成
了骨头，石块间的纹路变成了人的脉络。奇怪的是，丢卡利翁往后扔的石块都变
成男人，而妻子皮拉扔的石头全变成了女人。直到今天，人类并不否认他们的起
源和来历。这是坚强、刻苦、勤劳的一代。　　人类永远记住了他们是由什么物
质造成的。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事4 ：伊娥

    施瓦布

    彼拉斯齐人是古希腊最初的居民。他们的国王乃是伊那科斯。他有一个如花
似玉的女儿，名叫伊娥。有一次，伊娥在勒那草地上为他的父亲牧羊，奥林匹斯
圣山的主宰一眼看见了她，顿时产生了爱意。宙斯心中的爱情之火越来越炽热，
于是他扮作男人，来到人间，用甜美的语言引诱挑逗伊娥：" 哦，年轻的姑娘，
能够拥有你的人是多么幸福啊！可是世界上任何凡人都配不上你，你只适宜做万
神之王的妻子。告诉你吧，我就是宙斯，你不用害怕！中午时分酷热难挡，快跟
我到左边的树荫下去休息，你为什么在中午的烈日下折磨自己呢？你走进阴暗的
树林，不用害怕，我愿意保护你。我是执着天国权杖的神，可以把闪电直接送到
地面。" 　　姑娘非常害怕，为了逃避他的诱惑，飞快地奔跑起来。如果不是这
位主神施展他的权力，使整个地区陷入一片黑暗，她一定可以逃脱的。现在，她
被包裹在云雾之中。她因担心撞在岩石上或者失足落水而放慢了脚步。因此，落
入宙斯的手中。　　诸神之母赫拉是宙斯的妻子，她早已熟知丈夫的不忠实。他
背弃了妻子，却对凡人或半神的女儿滥施爱情。赫拉的猜疑与日俱增，她密切监
视着丈夫在人间的一切寻欢作乐的行为。这时，她突然惊奇地发现地上有一块地
方在晴天也云雾迷蒙。那不是自然形成的。赫拉顿时起了疑心，寻找她那不忠实
的丈夫。她寻遍了奥林匹斯圣山，就是找不到宙斯。" 如果我没有弄错的话，"
她恼怒地自言自语，" 丈夫一定在做伤害我感情的事！" 于是，她驾云降到地上，
命令包裹着引诱者和他的猎物的浓雾赶快散开。　　宙斯预料妻子来了，为了让
心爱的姑娘逃脱妻子的报复，他把伊那科斯的可爱的女儿变为一头雪白的小母牛。

    即使成了这副模样，俊秀的伊娥仍然很美丽。赫拉立即识破了丈夫的诡计，
假意称赞这头美丽的动物，并询问这是谁家的小母牛，是什么品种。宙斯在窘困
中，不得不撒谎说这头母牛只不过是地上的生物，是纯种。赫拉假装很满意他的
回答，但要求丈夫把这头美丽的动物作为礼物送给自己。现在受到欺骗的欺骗者
该怎么办呢？他左右为难：假如答应她的请求，他就失去了可爱的姑娘；假如拒
绝她的要求，势必引起她的猜疑和嫉妒，结果这位不幸的姑娘会遭到恶毒的报复。
想来想去，他决定暂时放弃姑娘，把这光艳照人的小母牛赠给妻子。赫拉装作心
满意足的样子，用一条带子系在小母牛的脖子上，然后得意洋洋地牵着这位遭劫
的姑娘走了。可是，女神虽说骗得了母牛，心里却仍然不放心。她知道要是找不
到一块安置她的情敌的可靠地方，她的心里总是不得安宁的。于是，她找到阿利
斯多的儿子阿耳戈斯。这个怪物好像特别适合于看守的差使，他有一百只眼睛，
在睡眠时只闭上一双眼睛，其余的都睁着，如同星星一样发着光，明亮有神。　
　赫拉雇了阿耳戈斯看守可怜的伊娥，使得宙斯无法劫走他的落难的情人。伊娥
在阿耳戈斯一百只眼睛的严密看守下，整天在长满丰盛青草的草如上吃草。阿耳
戈斯始终站在她的附近，瞪着一百只眼睛，盯住她不放，忠实地履行看守的职务。
有时候，他转过身去，背对着姑娘，可是他还是能够看到姑娘，因为他的额前脑
后都有眼睛。太阳下山时，他用锁链锁住她的脖子。她吃着苦草和树叶，睡在坚
硬冰凉的地上，饮着污浊的池水，因为她是一头小母牛。伊娥常常忘记她现在不
再是人类了。她想伸出可怜的双手，乞求阿耳戈斯的怜悯和同情，可是她突然想
起她已没有手臂了。她想以感人的语言向他哀求，但她一张口，只能发出哞哞的
吼叫，连她自己听了都吓了一跳。阿耳戈斯不是总在一个固定的牧场看守她，因
为赫拉吩咐他不断地变换伊娥的居处，使宙斯难以找到她。这样，伊娥的看守牵
着她在各地放牧。一天，伊娥发现来到了自己的故乡，来到一条她孩提时常常嬉
耍的河岸上。这时，伊娥第一次从清澈的河水中看到了自己的面容。在水中出现
一个有角的兽头时，她惊吓得不由自主地往后退了几步，不敢再看下去。怀着对
姐妹们和父亲伊那科斯的依恋之情，她来到他们身边，可是他们都不认识她。伊
那科斯抚摸着她美丽的身体，从小树上捋了一把树叶喂她。伊娥感激地舐着他的
手，用泪水和亲吻爱抚着他的手时，老人却一无所知，他不知道自己抚摸的是谁，
也不知道刚才谁在向他感恩。　　终于伊娥想出了一个拯救自己的主意。虽然她
变成了一头小母牛，可是她的思想却没有受损，这时她开始用脚在地上划出一行
字，这个举动引起了父亲的注意。伊那科斯很快从地面上的文字中知道站在面前
的原来是自己的亲生女儿。" 天哪，我是一个不幸的人！" 老人惊叫一声，伸出
双臂，紧紧地抱住落难女儿的脖颈，" 我走遍全国到处找你，想不到你成了这个
样子！

    唉，见到了你比不见你更悲哀！你为什么不说话呢？可怜啊，你不能给我说
一句安慰的话，只能用一声牛叫回答我！我以前真傻啊，一心想给你挑选一个般
配的夫婿，想着给你置办新娘的火把，赶办未来的婚事。现在，你却变成了一头
牛…

    …" 伊那科斯的话还没有讲完，阿耳戈斯这个残暴的看守，就从伊那科斯的
手里抢走了伊娥，牵着她走开了。然后，自己爬上一座高山，用他的一百只眼睛
警惕地注视着四周。　　宙斯不能忍受姑娘长期横遭折磨。他把儿子赫耳墨斯召
到跟前，命令他运用机谋，诱使伊那科斯闭上所有的眼睛。赫尔墨斯带上一根催
人昏睡的荆木棍，离开了父亲的宫殿，降落到人间。他丢下帽子和翅膀，只提着
木棍，看上去像个牧人。赫耳墨斯呼唤一群羊跟着他，来到草地上。这儿是伊娥
啃着嫩草、阿耳戈斯看守她的地方。赫耳墨斯抽出一枝牧笛。牧笛古色古香，优
雅别致，他吹起了乐曲，比人间牧人吹奏的更美妙，阿耳戈斯很喜欢这迷人的笛
音。他从高处坐着的石头上站起来，向下呼喊：" 吹笛子的朋友，不管你是谁，
我都热烈地欢迎你。来吧，坐到我身旁的岩石上，休息一会儿！别的地方的青草
都没有这里的更茂盛更鲜嫩。瞧，这儿的树荫下多舒服！" 　　赫耳墨斯说了声
谢谢，便爬上山坡，坐在他身边。两个人攀谈起来。他们越说越投机，不知不觉
白天快过去了。阿耳戈斯打了几个哈欠，一百只眼睛睡意朦胧。赫耳墨斯又吹起
牧笛，想把阿耳戈斯催入梦乡。可是阿耳戈斯怕他的女主人动怒，不敢松懈自己
的职责。

    尽管他的一百只眼皮都快支撑不住了，他还是拼命同瞌睡作斗争，让一部分
眼睛先睡，而让另一部分眼睛睁着，紧紧盯住小母牛，提防它乘机逃走。　　阿
耳戈斯虽说有一百只眼睛，但从来没有见过那种牧笛。　　他感到好奇，打听这
枝牧笛的来历。　　" 我很愿意告诉你，" 赫耳墨斯说，" 如果你不嫌天色已晚，
并且还有耐心听的话，我很乐意告诉你。从前，在阿耳卡狄亚的雪山上住着一个
著名的山林女神，她名叫哈玛得律阿得斯，又名绪任克斯。那时，森林神和农神
萨图恩都迷恋她的美貌，热烈追求她，但她总是巧妙地摆脱了他们的追逐，因为
她害怕结婚。如同束着腰带的狩猎女神阿耳忒弥斯一样，她要始终保持独身，过
处女生活，但最后当强大的山神潘在森林里漫游时，他看到了这个女神，便走近
她，凭着自己显赫的地位急切地向她求爱。但她拒绝了他，夺路而逃，不一会就
消失在茫茫的草原上，她一直逃到拉同河边。河水缓缓地流着，可是河面很宽，
她无法过去。姑娘很焦急，只得哀求她的守护女神阿耳忒弥斯同情她，在山神
还没追来之前，帮她改变模样。这时，山神潘奔到她面前。他张开双臂，一把抱
住站在河岸边的姑娘。但使他吃惊的是，他发现抱住的不是姑娘，而是一根芦苇。
山神忧郁地悲叹一声，声音经过芦苇管时变得又粗又响。这奇妙的声音总算使失
望的神}得到了安慰。" 好吧，变形的情人啊，" 他在痛苦中又突然高兴地喊叫
起来，" 即使如此，我们也要结合在一起！" 说完，他把芦苇切成长短不同的小
杆，用蜡把芦苇杆接起来，并以姑娘哈玛得律阿得斯的名字命名他的芦笛。从此
以后，我们就叫这种牧笛为绪任克斯。" 　　赫耳墨斯一面讲故事，一面目不转
睛地看着阿耳戈斯。故事还没有讲完，阿耳戈斯的眼睛一只只地依次闭上。最后，
他的一百只眼睛全闭上了，他沉沉昏睡过去。现在赫耳墨斯停止吹奏牧笛，他用
他的神杖轻触阿耳戈斯的一百只神眼，使它们睡得更深沉。阿耳戈斯终于抑制不
住地呼呼大睡，赫耳墨斯迅速抽出藏在上衣口袋里的一把利剑，齐脖子砍下他的
头颅。

    伊娥获得了自由。她仍然保持着小母牛的模样，只是已除掉了颈上的绳索。

    她高兴地在草地上来回奔跑，无拘无束。当然，下界发生的这一切事都逃不
了赫拉的目光。她又想出了一种新的折磨方法来对付自己的情敌。碰巧她抓到一
只牛虻。她让牛忙叮咬可爱的小母牛，咬得小母牛忍受不住，几乎发狂。她惊恐
万分，被牛虻追来逐去，逃遍了世界各地。它逃到高加索，逃到斯库提亚，逃到
亚马孙部落，逃到博斯普鲁斯海峡，逃到阿瑟夫海。她穿过海洋到了亚洲。最后，
经过长途跋涉，它绝望地来到了埃及。在尼罗河河岸上，伊娥疲惫万分，她前脚
跪下，昂起头，仰望着奥林匹斯圣山，眼睛里流露出哀求的目光。宙斯看到了她，
深深感动了，顿生怜悯之情，他即刻来到赫拉那里。他拥抱她，请她对可怜的姑
娘大发慈悲。姑娘虽然迷途在外，他说，她没有诱惑他，她是清白无辜的。他指
着神}立誓的斯提克斯河，即阴阳交界的冥河，向妻子发誓，以后他将放弃对姑
娘的爱情，不再追求她了。就在这时，赫拉也听到小母牛朝着奥林匹斯圣山发出
求教的哀鸣声。这位神}之母终于心软了，允许宙斯恢复伊娥的原形。　　宙斯
急忙来到尼罗河边，伸手抚摸着小母牛的背。奇迹立刻出现了：小母牛身上蓬乱
的牛毛消失了，牛角也缩了进去，牛眼变小，牛嘴变成小巧的人的双唇，肩膀和
两只手出现了，牛蹄突然消失，小母牛身上，除了美丽的白色以外，全都消失了。
伊娥从地上慢慢地站起来。她重新恢复了楚楚动人的美丽形象，格外令人怜爱。
就在尼罗河的河岸上，伊娥为宙斯生下了一个儿子厄帕福斯，他后来当了埃及国
王。

    当地人民十分爱戴这位神奇地得救了的女人，把她尊为女神。伊娥作为女君
主统治那地方很长时间。不过，她始终没有得到赫拉的彻底宽恕。赫拉唆使野蛮
的库埃特人抢走了她那年轻的儿子厄帕福斯。伊娥不得不再次到处漂泊，寻找她
的儿子。后来，宙斯用闪电劈死了库埃特人，她才在埃塞俄比亚的边境找到了儿
子。

    她带着儿子一起回到埃及，让儿子辅佐她治理国家。　　厄帕福斯长大后娶
门菲斯为妻，生下女儿利彼亚。利比亚地方就以她而得名，因为厄帕福斯的女儿
曾经有过这个名字。厄帕福斯和他的母亲在埃及受到人们的尊敬和爱戴。在他们
死后，为纪念他们，埃及人为他们建立庙宇，把他们当作神来崇拜，她是伊西斯
神，他是阿庇斯神。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事5 ：法厄同

    施瓦布

    太阳神的宫殿，是用华丽的圆柱支撑的，镶着闪亮的黄金和璀灿的宝石。飞
檐嵌着雪白的象牙，两扇银质的大门上雕着美丽的花纹和人像，记载着人间无数
美好而又古老的传说。一天，太阳神福玻斯的儿子法厄同跨进宫殿，要找父亲谈
话。他不敢走得太近，因为父亲身上散发着一股炙人的热光，靠得太近他会受不
了。　　福玻斯穿着古铜色的衣裳。他坐在饰着耀眼的绿宝石的宝座上，在他的
左右依次站着他的文武随从。一边是日神、月神、年神、世纪神等；另一边是四
季神：春神年轻娇艳，戴着花项链；夏神目光炯炯有神，披着金黄的麦穗衣裳；
秋神仪态万千，手上捧着芬芳诱人的葡萄；冬神寒气逼人，雪花般的白发显示了
无限的智慧。有着一双慧眼的福玻斯正襟危坐，正要发话，突然看到儿子来了。

    儿子看到这天地间威武的仪仗正在暗自惊讶。　　" 什么风把你吹到父亲的
宫殿来了，我的孩子？" 他亲切地问道。　　" 尊敬的父亲，" 儿子法厄同回答
说，" 因为大地上有人嘲笑我，谩骂我的母亲克吕墨涅。他们说我自称是天国的
子孙，其实不是，还说我是杂种，说我父亲是不知姓名的野男人。所以我来请求
父亲给我一些凭证，让我向全世界证明我确是你的儿子。" 　　他讲完话，福玻
斯收敛围绕头颅的万丈光芒，吩咐年轻的儿子走近一步。他拥抱着儿子，说："
我的孩子，你的母亲克吕墨涅已将真情告诉了你，我永远也不会否认你是我的儿
子，不管在什么地方。为了消除你的怀疑，你向我要求一份礼物吧。　　我指着
冥河发誓，一定满足你的愿望！" 　　法厄同没有等到父亲说完，立即说：" 那
么请你首先满足我梦寐以求的愿望吧，让我有一天时间，独自驾驶你的那辆带翼
的太阳车！" 　　太阳神一阵惊恐，脸上流露出后悔莫及的神色。他一连摇了三
四次头，最后忍不住地大声说：" 哦，我的孩子，我如果能够收回诺言，哪该多
好啊！你的要求远远超出了你的力量。你还年轻，而且又是人类！没有一个神敢
像你一样提出如此狂妄的要求。因为除了我以外，他们中间还没有一个人能够站
在喷射火焰的车轴上。我的车必须经过陡峻的路。即使在早晨，马匹精力充沛，
拉车行路也很艰难。旅程的中点是在高高的天上。当我站在车上到达天之绝顶时，
也感到头晕目眩。只要我俯视下面，看到辽阔的大地和海洋在我的眼前无边无际
地展开，我吓得双腿都发颤。过了中点以后，道路又急转直下，需要牢牢地抓住
缰绳，小心地驾驶。甚至在下面高兴地等待我的海洋女神也常常担心，怕我一不
注意从天上掉入万丈海底。你只要想一下，天在不断地旋转，我必须竭力保持与
它平行逆转。因此，即使我把车借给你，你又如何能驾驭它？我可爱的儿子，趁
现在还来得及，放弃你的愿望吧。你可以重提一个要求，从天地间的一切财富中
挑选一样。

    我指着冥河起过誓，你要什么就能得到什么！" 　　可是这位年轻人很固执，
不肯改变他的愿望，可是父亲已经立过神圣的誓言，怎么办呢？他不得不拉着儿
子的手，朝太阳车走去。车轴、车辕和车轮都是金的。车轮上的辐条是银的，辔
头上嵌着闪亮的宝石。法厄同对太阳车精美的工艺赞叹不已。不知不觉中，天已
破晓，东方露出了一抹朝霞。星星一颗颗隐没了，新月的弯角也消失在西方的天
边上。现在，福玻斯命令时光女神赶快套马。女神们从豪华的马槽旁把喷吐火焰
的马匹牵了出来，马匹都喂饱了可以长生不老的饲料。她们忙碌地套上漂亮的辔
具。

    然后父亲用圣膏涂抹儿子的面颊，使他可以抵御熊熊燃烧的火焰。他把光芒
万丈的太阳帽戴到儿子的头上，不断叹息地警告儿子说：" 孩子，千万不要使用
鞭子，但要紧紧地抓住缰绳。马会自己飞奔，你要控制它们，使它们跑慢些。你
不能过分地弯下腰去，否则，地面会烈焰腾腾，甚至会火光冲天。可是你也不能
站得太高，当心别把天空烧焦了。上去吧，黎明前的黑暗已经过去，抓住缰绳吧！
或者――可爱的儿子，现在还来得及重新考虑一下，抛弃你的妄想，把车子交给
我，使我把光明送给大地，而你留在这里看着吧！" 　　这个年轻人好像没有听
到父亲的话，他嗖的一声跳上车子，兴冲冲地抓住缰绳，朝着忧心忡忡的父亲点
点头，表示由衷地感谢。　　四匹有翼的马嘶鸣着，它们灼热的呼吸在空中喷出
火花。

    马蹄踩动，法厄同让马儿拉着车辕，即将启程了。外祖母忒提斯走上前来，
她不知道外孙法厄同的命运，亲自给他打开两扇大门。世界广阔的空间展现在她
的眼前。马匹登上路程飞速向前，奋勇地冲破了拂晓的雾霭。　　马匹似乎想到
今天驾驭它们的是另外一个人，因为套在颈间的辄具比平日里轻了许多，如同一
艘载重过轻、在大海中摇荡的船只，太阳车在空中颠簸摇晃，像是一辆空车。后
来马匹觉察到今天的情况异常，它们离开了平日的故道，任性地奔突起来。　　
法厄同颠上颠下，感到一阵颤栗，失去了主张，不知道朝哪一边拉绳，也找不到
原来的道路，更没有办法控制撒野奔驰的马匹。当他偶尔朝下张望时，看见一望
无际的大地展现在眼前，他紧张得脸色发白，双膝也因恐惧颤抖起来。他回过头
去，看到自己已经走了很长一段路程，望望前面，路途更长。他手足无措，不知
道怎么办才好，只是呆呆看着远方，双手抓住缰绳，既不敢放松，也不敢过分拉
紧。

    他想吆喝马匹，但又不知道它们的名字。惊慌之余，他看到星星散布在空中，
奇异而又可怕的形状如同魔鬼。他不禁倒抽一口冷气，不由自主地松掉了手中的
缰绳。马匹拉动太阳车越过了天空的最高点，开始往下滑行。它们高兴得索性离
开了原有的道路，漫无边际地在陌生的空中乱跑，一会儿高，一会儿低，有时几
乎触到高空的恒星，有时几乎坠入邻近的半空。它们掠过云层，云彩被烧烤得直
冒白烟。后来，马儿又漫不经心地拉着车，差点撞在一座高山顶上。　　大地受
尽炙烤，因灼热而龟裂，水分全蒸发了。田里几乎冒出了火花，草原干枯，森林
起火。大火蔓延到广阔的平原。庄稼烧毁，耕地成了一片沙漠，无数城市冒着浓
烟，农村烧成灰烬，农民被烤得焦头烂额。山丘和树林烈焰腾腾。据说，黑人的
皮肤就是那时变成黑色的。河川翻滚着热水，可怕地溯流而上，直到源头，河川
都干涸了。大海在急剧地凝缩，从前是湖泊的地方，现在成了干巴巴的沙砾。　
　法厄同看到世界各地都在冒火，热浪滚滚，他自己也感到炎热难忍。他的每一
次呼吸好像是从滚热的大烟囱里冒出来似的。他感到脚下的车子好像一座燃烧的
火炉。

    浓烟、热气把他包围住了，从地面上爆裂开来的灰石从四面八方朝他袭来。
最后他支持不住了，马和车完全失去了控制。乱窜的烈焰烧着了他的头发。他一
头扑倒，从豪华的太阳车里跌落下去。可怜的法厄同如同燃烧着的一团火球，在
空中激旋而下。最后，他远离了他的家园，广阔的埃利达努斯河接受了他，埋葬
了他的遗体。　　福玻斯目睹了这悲惨的情景，他抱住头，陷于深深的悲哀之中。

    水泉女神那伊阿得斯同情这位遭难的年轻人，埋葬了他。可怜他的尸体被烧
得残缺不全。绝望的母亲克吕墨涅与她的女儿赫利阿得斯（又叫法厄同尼腾）抱
头痛哭。她们一连哭了四个月，最后温柔的妹妹变成了白杨树。她们的眼泪成了
晶莹的琥珀。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事6 ：欧罗巴

    施瓦布

    腓尼基王国的首府泰乐和西顿是块富饶的地方。国王阿革诺耳的女儿欧罗巴，
一直深居在父亲的宫殿里。一天，在半夜时，她做了一个奇怪的梦。她梦见世界
的两大部分亚细亚和对面的大陆变成两个女人的模样，在激烈地争斗，想要占有
她。其中一位妇女非常陌生，而另一位，她就是亚细亚，长得完全跟当地人一样。

    亚细亚十分激动，她温柔而又热情地要求得到她，说自己是把她从小喂养大
的母亲；而陌生的女人却像抢劫一样强行抓住她的胳膊，将她拉走。" 跟我走吧，
亲爱的，" 陌生女人对她说，" 我带你去见宙斯！因为命运女神指定你作为他的
情人。" 　　欧罗巴醒来，心慌乱地跳个不停。她从床上坐起，刚才的梦还清晰
地浮现在眼前，跟白天的真事一样分明。她呆呆地坐了很久，一动也不动。" 天
上哪一位神，" 她寻思着，" 给我这样一个梦呢？梦中的那位陌生女人是谁呢？
我是多么渴望能够遇上她啊！她待我是多么慈爱，即使动手抢我时，还温柔地向
我微笑着！但愿神}让我重新返回到梦境中去！" 　　清晨，明亮的阳光抹去了
姑娘夜间的梦景。一会儿，和她年岁相仿的许多姑娘都聚扰过来，同她游戏玩耍。

    显然她们都是显赫家庭的女儿。她们陪她散步，并把她引到海边的草地上，
这是姑娘们乐意聚会的地方。海边，鲜花遍地，美不胜收。姑娘们穿着鲜艳的衣
服，上面绣着美丽的花卉。欧罗巴穿了一件长襟裙衣，光彩照人。衣服上用金丝
银线织出了许多神}生活的景致，这件价值无比的衣服还是火神赫淮斯托斯的杰
作。

    善于呼风唤雨、常常引起地震的海神波塞冬曾把这件衣服送给利彼亚，那时
他们正在热恋之中。后来，这件衣服成了传家宝，传到儿子阿革诺耳手上。欧罗
巴穿上漂亮的衣服，楚楚动人。她跑在同伴的前头，奔到海边的草地上。草地上
鲜花怒放，格外芬香。姑娘们欢笑着散了开来，采摘自己喜欢的花朵，有的摘水
仙，有的摘风信子，有的寻紫罗兰，有的找百里香，还有的喜欢黄颜色的藏红花。
欧罗巴也很快发现了她要找的花。她站在几位姑娘中间，双手高高地举着一束火
焰般的红玫瑰，看上去真像一尊爱情女神。　　姑娘们采集了各种鲜花，然后围
在一起，坐在草地上，大家动手，编织花环。为了感谢草地仙子，她们把花环挂
在翠绿的树枝上献给她。　　宙斯为年轻的欧罗巴的美貌深深地打动了。可是，
他害怕妒嫉成性的妻子赫拉发怒，同时又怕以自己的形象出现难以诱惑这纯洁的
姑娘，于是他想出了一个诡计，变成了一头公牛。那是怎样的一头公牛啊！它不
是普普通通、背着轭具、拉着沉重大车的公牛，而是一头膘肥体壮、高贵而华丽
的牛。牛角小巧玲珑，犹如精雕细刻的工艺品，晶莹闪亮，像珍贵的钻石。额前
闪烁着一块新月型的银色胎记。它的毛皮是金黄色的，一双蓝色明亮的眼睛燃烧
着情欲，流露出深深的情意。当然，宙斯在变形前，已经把赫耳墨斯叫到跟前，
吩咐他做一件事。" 快过来，我的孩子，我的命令的忠实执行者，" 他说，" 你
看到腓尼基王国了吗？你快下去，把在山坡上吃草的国王的牲口统统赶到海边去。

    " 赫耳墨斯立即鼓动翅膀，飞到西顿的牧场。他把国王的牲口从山上一直赶
到草地，赶到阿革诺耳的女儿欧罗巴快乐地采集鲜花、编织花环的地方。可是赫
耳墨斯不知道，他的父亲宙斯已经变成公牛，混在国王的牛群中。　　牛群在草
地上慢慢散开，只有神}化身的大公牛来到山坡的草地上，欧罗巴和一群姑娘正
坐在这里嬉戏。公牛骄傲地穿过肥沃的草地，可是它并不咄咄逼人，也不叫人感
到可怕，它好像很温顺，很可爱。欧罗巴和姑娘们都夸赞公牛那高贵的气概和安
静的姿态，她们兴致勃勃地走近公牛，看着它，还伸出手抚摸它油光闪闪的牛背。
公牛似乎很通人性，它越来越靠近姑娘，最后，它依偎在欧罗巴的身旁。欧罗巴
吓了一跳，不禁往后倒退几步。当她看到公牛只是驯服地站在那里，又壮着胆子
走上前来。把手里的花束送到公牛的嘴边。公牛撒娇地舐着鲜花和姑娘的手。姑
娘用手拭去公牛嘴上的白沫，温柔地抚摸着牛身，她越来越喜欢这头漂亮的公牛，
最后壮着胆子在牛的前额上轻轻地吻了一下。公牛发出一声欢叫，这叫声不像普
通的牛叫，听起来如同是吕狄亚人的牧笛声，在山谷回荡。公牛温顺地躺倒在姑
娘的脚旁，无限爱恋地瞅着她，摆着头，向她示意，爬上自己宽阔的牛背。

    欧罗巴着实高兴，呼唤她的女伴们。" 你们快过来，我们可以坐在这美丽公
牛的背上。我想牛背上坐得下四个人。这头公牛又温顺又友好，一点也不像别的
公牛。

    我想它大概有灵性，像人一样，只不过不会说话！" 她一边说，一边从女伴
们的手上接过花环，挂在牛角上，然后壮着胆子骑上牛背，她的女伴们仍然犹豫
着不敢骑。　　公牛达到目的，便从地上跃起，轻松缓慢地走着，但仍使欧罗巴
的女伴们赶不上。当它走出草地，一片光秃秃的沙滩展现在面前时，公牛加快了
速度，像奔马一样前进。欧罗巴还没有来得及知道发生了什么事，公牛已经纵身
跳进了大海，高兴地背着他的猎物游走了。姑娘用右手紧紧地抓着牛角，左手抱
着牛背，海风吹动着她的衣服，好像张开的船帆。她非常害怕，回过头张望着在
远方的故乡，大声呼喊女伴们，可是风又把她的声音送了回来。海水在公牛身旁
缓缓地流过，姑娘生怕弄湿衣衫，竭力提起双脚。公牛却像一艘海船一样，平稳
地向大海的远处游去。不久海岸消失了，太阳沉入了水面。在夜色朦胧中，惊恐
不安的欧罗巴除了看到波浪和星星外，什么也看不到，她感到十分孤寂。　　公
牛驮着姑娘一直往前，在游泳中迎来了黎明，又在水中游了整整一天。周围永远
是无边无际的海水，可是公牛却十分灵巧地分开波浪，竟没有一点水珠沾在他那
可爱的猎物身上。傍晚时分，它们终于来到了远方的海岸，公牛爬上陆地，来到
一棵大树旁，让姑娘从背上轻轻滑下来，自己却突然消失了。姑娘正在惊异，却
看到面前站着一个俊逸如天神的男子。他告诉她，他是克里特岛的主人，如果姑
娘愿意嫁给他，他可以保护姑娘。欧罗巴绝望之余便朝他伸出一只手去，表示答
应他的要求。宙斯实现了自己的愿望，后来，他又像来时一样地消失了。　　一
轮红日冉冉升起，欧罗巴从昏迷中渐渐醒了过来。她惊慌失措地望着四周，呼喊
着父亲的名字。这时候，她想起了发生的事情，于是十分哀伤地怨诉着：" 我是
个卑劣的女儿，怎么可以呼喊父亲的名字？我不慎失身，必须忘掉一切！" 她仔
细地审视周围，心里反复地问着：" 我从哪儿来，往哪儿去？难道我真的醒着，
这件丑事难道是真的吗？不，我肯定是无辜的，她许只是一场梦幻在困扰我。"
　　姑娘说着，用手揉了揉双眼，她好像想驱除丑恶的梦魇似的。可是那些陌生
的景物还在，不知名的山峦和树林包围着她，大海的波涛汹涌澎湃，冲击着悬崖
峭壁，发出惊天动地的轰隆声。绝望之中，姑娘忿恨不已，她高声地呼喊起来。
" 天哪，要是该死的公牛再出现在我的面前，我一定折断它的牛角，可是这只能
是一种愿望而已！家乡远在天边，我除了死还有什么出路呢？天上的神}，给我
送上一头雄狮或者猛虎吧！" 可是猛兽没有出现，她看到的只是一片陌生的景物。
太阳从蔚蓝的天空里露出了容光焕发的笑脸。就好像被复仇女神所驱使，欧罗巴
突然跳起来。" 可怜的欧罗巴！" 她大声地呼号着，" 如果你不想结束这种不名
誉的生活，难道你不会感到父亲会咒骂你吗？你难道愿意给一位野兽的君王当侍
妾，辛辛苦苦地为他当女佣吗？你怎么可以忘掉自己是一位高贵国王的公主？"
　　惨遭命运遗弃的姑娘痛恨万分，她想到了死，可是又拿不出死的勇气。突然，
她听到背后传来一阵低低的嘲笑声。姑娘惊讶地回过头去，她看到女神阿佛洛狄
忒站在面前，浑身闪着天神的光彩。女神旁边是她的小儿子爱情天使，他弯弓搭
箭，跃跃欲试。女神嘴角露着微笑，说：" 美丽的姑娘，赶快息怒吧！你所诅咒
的公牛马上就来，它会把牛角送来给你让你折断。我就是给你托梦的那位女子。
欧罗巴，你可以聊以自慰了吧！把你带走的是宙斯本人。你现在成了地面上的女
神，你的名字将与世长存，从此，收容你的这块大陆就按你的名字称作欧罗巴！
" 欧罗巴恍然大悟，她默认了自己的命运，跟宙斯生了三个强大而睿智的儿子，
他们是弥诺斯、拉达曼提斯和萨耳珀冬。弥诺斯和拉达曼提斯后来成为冥界判官。

    萨耳珀冬是一位大英雄，当了小亚细亚吕喀亚王国的国王。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事7 ：卡德摩斯

    施瓦布

    卡德摩斯是腓尼基国王阿革诺耳的儿子，欧罗巴的哥哥。宙斯带走欧罗巴后，
国王阿革诺耳痛苦万分，他急忙派卡德摩斯和其他的三个儿子福尼克斯、基立克
斯和菲纽斯外出寻找，并告诉他们，找不到妹妹不准回来。卡德摩斯出门以后东
寻西找，始终打听不到妹妹欧罗巴的消息。他无可奈何，不敢回归故乡，因此请
求太阳神福玻斯。阿波罗赐给神谕，告诉该在何处安身。阿波罗迅即回答说："
你将在一块孤寂的牧场上遇到一头牛，这头牛还没有套上轭具，它会带着你一直
往前。当它躺在草地上休息的时候，你可以在那里造一座城市，把它命名为底比
斯。" 　　卡德摩斯刚要离开阿波罗赐给他神谕的卡斯泰利阿圣泉，突然，看到
前面绿色的草地上有一头母牛在啃草。他朝着太阳神福玻斯祈祷，表示感谢，随
后跟着母牛走去。它领着他淌过了凯菲索斯浅流，站在岸边不走了。母牛抬起头
大声叫着。它又回过头来，看着跟在后面的卡德摩斯和他的随从，然后满意地躺
在绿草深软的草地里。　　卡德摩斯怀着感激之情跪在地上，亲吻着这块陌生的
土地。后来，他想给宙斯呈献一份祭品，于是派出仆人，命他们到活水水源处取
水，以供神}品饮。附近有一片樵夫从来没有用斧子砍伐过的古老的森林，林中
山石间涌出一股清泉，蜿蜒流转，穿过了层层灌木。泉水晶莹、甜蜜。　　在这
片森林里隐藏着一条毒龙，紫红的龙冠闪闪发光，眼睛赤红，好像喷射着熊熊的
火焰，身体庞大，口中伸出三条信子，犹如三叉戟，口中排着三层利齿。腓尼基
的仆人们走进山林，正要把水罐沉入水中打水时，蓝色的巨龙突然从洞中伸出脑
袋，口中发出一阵可怕的响声。仆人们吓得连水罐都从手中滑落了，浑身的血液
像是凝固了。毒龙把它多鳞的身体盘成一团，然后蜷曲着身子往前耸动，高昂着
头，凶狠地俯视着树林。最后，它终于朝腓尼基人冲了过来，把他们冲得七零八
落，有的被咬死，有的被它缠住勒死，有的被它喷出的臭气窒息而死，剩下的人
也被毒涎毒死了。　　卡德摩斯想不出为什么他的仆人去了这么久还不回来，最
后，他决定亲自去寻找他们。他披上一件狮皮，手执长矛和标枪，此外还有一颗
勇敢的心，它比任何武器更坚强。卡德摩斯进入树林时看见一大堆尸体，死去的
全是他的仆人。他也看到恶龙得胜似地吐出血红的信子，舐食着遍地的尸体。"
可怜的朋友们啊！" 卡德摩斯痛苦万分地叫了起来，" 我要为你们复仇，否则就
跟你们死在一起！" 说着，他抓起一块大石头朝着巨龙投去。这样大的石头，连
城墙和塔楼都能打穿砸塌。可是毒龙竟无动于衰，它坚硬的厚皮和鳞壳保护着它，
如同铁甲。卡德摩斯又狠狠地扔去一杆标枪，枪尖深深地刺入恶龙的内脏。巨龙
疼痛难熬，狂暴地转过头来咬下背上的标枪，又用身体将它压碎，可是枪尖却仍
然留在体内，恶龙受了重伤。卡德摩斯无畏的行动激怒了恶龙，它的咽喉迅速地
膨胀开来，喷吐着剧毒的白沫。它像箭似地冲来，卡德摩斯连忙后退了一步，用
狮皮裹住身体，用长矛刺进龙口，恶龙一口咬住了长矛。卡德摩斯拼命用力抵住
长矛，恶龙的牙齿纷纷掉落。终于恶龙的脖子里流出了血水，但伤势并不严重，
还能躲避攻击。卡德摩斯很难一下子置它于死地。卡德摩斯越斗越勇。最后，他
提着宝剑，看准机会，一剑朝恶龙的脖颈刺去。这一剑刺得又狠又重，不仅刺穿
恶龙的脖颈，而且刺进后面的一棵大栎树里，把恶龙紧紧钉在树身上，恶龙被制
服了。　　卡德摩斯久久地凝视着被刺死的恶龙。当他终于想离开的时候，只见
帕拉斯。雅典娜站在他的身旁，命令他把龙的牙齿播种在松软的泥土里，这是未
来种族的种子。卡德摩斯听从女神的话，他在地上开了一条宽阔的沟，然后把龙
的牙齿慢慢地撒入土内。突然，泥土下面开始活动起来。卡德摩斯首先看到一杆
长矛的枪尖露了出来，然后又看到土里冒出了一顶武士的头盔。整片树林在晃动。

    不久，泥土下面又露出了肩膀、胸脯和四肢，最后一个全副武装的武士从土
里站起来。当然，还不止一个。不一会，地下长出了一整队武士。　　卡德摩斯
吃了一惊，他准备投入新的战斗，连忙摆开了架势。可是泥土中生出的一个武士
对他喊道：" 别拿武器反对我们，千万别参加我们兄弟之间的战争！" 他一边说，
一边抽出剑对准刚从泥土中生长出来的一位兄弟狠狠地挥去，而他自己又被别人
用标枪刺倒在地。一时间，一队人厮杀起来，杀得难解难分。大地母亲吞饮着她
所生的第一批儿子的鲜血。最后只剩下五个人，其中一人，后来取名为厄喀翁，
他首先响应雅典娜的建议，放下武器，愿意和解，其他的人也同意了。　　腓尼
基王子卡德摩斯在五位士兵的帮助下建立了一座新城市。根据太阳神福玻斯的旨
意，卡德摩斯把这座城市叫做底比斯。诸神为嘉奖卡德摩斯，便把美丽的姑娘哈
墨尼亚嫁给他为妻，并参加了婚礼，送了不少礼物。爱与美的女神阿佛洛狄忒，
即哈墨尼亚的母亲，送了一根贵重的项链和一条做工精致的丝面纱。　　卡德摩
斯和哈墨尼亚生了女儿塞墨勒。宙斯对塞墨勒十分爱慕。由于受到赫拉的诱惑，
塞墨勒曾要求宙斯显露一下神的威仪。宙斯因为答应过要满足姑娘的要求，不敢
食言，便驾着雷电，走近姑娘。塞墨勒忍受不住，临死前给宙斯生下一个孩子，
这就是狄俄尼索斯，又叫巴克科斯。宙斯把孩子交给塞墨勒的妹妹伊诺抚养。后
来，伊诺带着另一个儿子墨里凯耳特斯为躲避丈夫阿塔玛斯的追杀，不幸失足落
海。母子两人被波塞冬救起，当了救助落难人的海神。从此以后，伊诺称作洛宇
科忒阿，她的儿子称作帕勒蒙。后来，卡德摩斯和哈墨尼亚年事已高，为子女们
的不幸感到哀伤，于是双双前往伊里利亚。　　最后变作两条大蛇，死后进了天
堂。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事8 ：彭透斯

    施瓦布

    酒神巴克科斯，又叫狄俄尼索斯，是宙斯和塞墨勒的儿子，即卡德摩斯的外
孙，他被封为果实神，又是首先种植葡萄的神。　　狄俄尼索斯是在印度长大的。

    不久，他离开了养育和庇护自己的诸位仙女，去各地旅行，向世人传授种植
葡萄的技术，并要求人们建立神庙来供奉他。他对待朋友宽厚大方，但是对不相
信他是神}的人却常常施以残酷的惩罚。不久，狄俄尼索斯声名传遍了希腊，并
传到他的故乡底比斯。那时候，卡德摩斯已经把王国传给彭透斯。彭透斯是泥土
所生的厄喀翁与阿高厄的儿子。阿高厄是酒神巴克科斯母亲的妹妹。彭透斯侮慢
神}，尤其憎恨他的亲戚狄俄尼索斯。所以，当酒神巴克科斯带着一群狂热的信
徒来到那里，并准备对底比斯的国王阐述神道时，彭透斯却顽固地不听年老的盲
人占卜者提瑞西阿斯的警告和劝说。当有人告诉他，底比斯城内的许多男人、妇
女和女孩子都追随赞美新来的神}时，彭透斯愤怒极了。" 是什么使你们发了疯，
竟成群结队地追随他？你们尽是些懦弱的傻瓜和疯癫的女人，你们难道忘记你们
的英雄的祖先了？你们难道甘愿让一个娇生惯养的男孩征服底比斯吗？他是一位
图虚荣的懦夫，头上戴着一个葡萄藤花环，身上穿的不是铠甲，而是紫金的长袍。
他不会骑马，是个逃避每场战斗的懦夫。你们一旦清醒过来，就会看到，他实际
上跟我们一样是个凡人。我是他的堂兄弟，宙斯并不是他的父亲。他的显赫的教
仪全是虚假的一套！" 他骂骂咧咧地说。接着他又转过脸来，命令仆人们把这一
新教的教主给抓起来，套上脚镣手铐。　　彭透斯的亲戚和朋友们听了他傲慢的
语言和命令大吃一惊，十分害怕。他的外祖父卡德摩斯也摇着白发苍苍的头，表
示反对。可是一切劝说却更加激怒了彭透斯。　　这时候，派去执行任务的仆人
都头破血流地逃了回来。　　" 你们在什么地方遇到了巴克科斯？" 彭透斯愤怒
地大声问道。　　" 我们根本没有看到巴克科斯。我们抓了他的一个随从，他好
像跟随他的时间并不长。" 仆人们据实回答。　　彭透斯仇恨地瞪着抓来的人，
大声同道：" 该死的东西，你叫什么名字？父母亲是谁，家住何方？为什么信奉
新的教仪？" 抓来的人无所畏惧，平静地回答说：" 我叫阿克忒斯，家乡在梅俄
尼恩。我的父母亲都是普通人，既没有牲口，也没有土地。父亲只教我用钓竿钓
鱼，因为这套本领就是他的财富。后来我学会开船，熟悉天象、观察风向，并且
知道哪里是最好的港口，我成了一个航海者。有一次，船在开往爱琴海提洛斯岛
的时候，到了一处不知名的沙潍。我从船上跳下来，一个人躲在岸边过了一夜。
第二天，我迎着朝霞爬上一座山地，试试风力、风向。这时候，我们船上的伙伴
们也纷纷上岸。我在回船的途中遇上他们，只是他们还牵着一个男孩，他们是在
无人的荒滩上制服这个男孩的。男孩长得很英俊，像女孩儿一样漂亮，他好像渴
醉了酒，走起路来踉踉跄跄，跟睡着了似的，很难跟上大家的步伐。　　"'哪位
神隐藏在这个孩子的心里？' 我问众人。　　"'不知道，我们肯定他是一位天神。
' "'不管你是谁，' 我继续说，' 我请求保佑我们一切顺利！原谅那些将你带走
的人吧！' 　　"'你在嘀咕什么？' 一名船员叫了起来，' 别向他作祷告吧！

    ' 　　" 别的人也嘲笑我，我根本无法与他们对阵。他们中间一个最年轻最
壮实的小伙子，其实是个凶狠的杀人犯，作案后逃亡出来，他抓住我的衣领，把
我朝水里扔去。我如果不是偶然抓住船上的一根绳索，肯定会淹死。这时候，大
家七手八脚地把男孩拖上大船，他躺在那里，像是睡熟了。后来，他被大家叫醒，
于是来到船员中间，大声问道：' 你们为什么大声喧哗？我怎么会来到这里？你
们要把我送到哪儿去？' 　　"'你不用害怕，' 有一个阴险的船员回答说，' 告
诉我们你愿意去的港口，我们将按照你的心愿，把你一直送到那里。' 　　"'好
吧，' 男孩说，' 请你们把船开往那克索斯岛，那里是我的故乡！' 　　" 这批
骗人的水手假心假意地答应他，并且吩咐我立即扬帆，准备启程。那克索斯岛位
于我们的右边。可是当我升帆时，他们却向我眨眼低声说：' 你这个笨蛋，你在
干什么？你难道疯了吗？向左！' 　　"'我不明白，那请你们换一个人来执行命
令！

    ' 说完我就退到一边。　　"'好像航行真的离不开你似的！' 一个粗暴的人
嘲弄地说，同时走上前来，升起船帆。就这样，那克索斯在右边，船却向着相反
的方向前进。男孩似乎这时才发现他们的骗局，他嘴角挂着一丝冷笑，在后甲板
上眺望着大海。他佯装绝望的样子，哀求着：' 呵，水手们，你们答应把我送到
那克索斯，现在行驶的方向错了！你们这批人欺骗一个孩子，那是没有道理的。
' 水手们只是嘲笑般地看着他和我，手上不停地划桨，没有改变方向。突然，船
抛在海上，一动也不动了，好像搁浅似的，不管水手们如何用桨划水，都无法前
进。

    一会儿，葡萄藤缠住了船桨，藤蔓攀上了桅杆。　　" 巴克科斯――原来男
孩就是他，神采奕奕地站在那里，前额束着葡萄叶做成的发带，手中握着缠着葡
萄藤的神杖，在他的周围伏着猛虎、山猫和山豹。香甜的葡萄酒味传遍全船。水
手们吓得跳了起来。第一个人刚要叫喊，发现他的嘴唇和鼻子已连在一起，变成
了鱼嘴。其他人还没来得及发出惊叫，就遭到了同样的命运：他们身上长出了蓝
色的鳞片，脊背弯曲起来，双臂缩成了鳍，而两只脚早就变成了尾巴。所有的人
都变成了鱼，从甲板上跳入大海，上下漂游。船上一共２０个人，只剩下我安然
无恙。

    不过我四肢发抖，随时等着失去我的人形。可是，巴克科斯却友好地走上前
来，因为我没有伤害过他，所以他说：' 你别害怕，请把我送往那克索斯。' 当
我们到达那里时，他把我拉在祭坛旁，将我封为侍候神}的仆人。""我们已不耐
烦听你这套废话，" 国王彭透斯叫道，" 来人，把他抓起来，叫他受千种苦刑，
然后把他押在地牢里！" 奴仆们遵命把他捆绑着关进了地牢。可是一只看不见的
手却把他放走了。　　国王十分愤怒，开始大规模地迫害巴克科斯的信徒。彭透
斯的生身母亲阿高厄和几位姐妹都参加了热烈的礼拜活动。国王派人捕捉她们，
并把巴克科斯的信徒都统统关进大牢里。可是，没有任何人的帮助，他们的手铐
脚镣自动脱落，监狱的门大开。他们怀着对巴克科斯的敬仰，回到了树林里。派
去捉拿酒神的仆人也惶惑地走了回来，因为巴克科斯微笑着甘愿让他套上枷锁。
巴克科斯站在国王面前，国王尽管不想看，但酒神的年轻美貌仍然吸引了他的目
光，他感到惊讶不已。但他还是顽固不化，把酒神作为盗用巴克科斯的名字的骗
子。

    国王叫人给酒神钉上重镣，关在靠近马厩的一个山洞里。可是酒神一声令下，
随即地动山摇。洞口的砖墙被震塌，手脚上的镣铐也松开了。他安然无恙地走了
出来，回到他的追随者中间，显得比以前更漂亮，更英俊。　　又有一名报信的
人来到国王彭透斯面前，向他汇报那些狂热的妇女们在树林里作出的奇迹，而他
的母亲和姐妹们正是这批妇女的领头人。她们只要用手杖敲击岩壁，石头缝里顿
时流出了清泉和美酒，溪水中流淌着牛奶，空心的树干里滴出了蜂蜜。　　" 是
的，" 一位打探消息的人补充说，" 如果你自己在场，亲眼看到神}，那你一定
会朝他跪下去！" 　　彭透斯更加怒不可遏，他命令全副武装的步兵和骑兵去驱
散大批信徒。不料巴克科斯却亲自来到国王面前，他答应将女信徒一起带来，但
国王必须穿上女人的衣衫，因为他是男人，而且还未入教，女人们会把他撕成碎
片的。

    国王彭透斯非常勉强而且怀疑地接受了建议，他跟在酒神的后面，走到城外，
这时却突然中了魔法，这是万能的神}送给他的教训。他好像觉得眼前有两个太
阳，一个双倍大的底比斯城，每一座城门都是原来的两倍高，而巴克科斯在他看
来却像一头公牛，头上有一对巨大的牛角。他充满着对巴克科斯的激情，祈求得
到一根神杖，他拿到手上，兴奋地往前跑去。　　他们来到一座深山大谷，周围
布满了松树。巴克科斯的女信徒们聚拢过来，向着她们的神}唱着颂歌，她们用
新鲜的葡萄藤缠着她们的神杖，但彭透斯已经双目失神，也许是巴克科斯故意引
他走迂回的路，所以他没有看见狂热地聚拢过来的妇女们。现在，酒神把一只手
伸向天空，奇迹出现了，那手一直伸到他抓住的松树的树冠上，将它弯曲下来，
就像拨弄一根柳树的树枝一样，然后让彭透斯坐在上面，让松树慢慢地回到先前
的位置。奇怪的是彭透斯却没有掉下来，他稳稳地坐在高高的树冠上。山谷里许
多巴克科斯的女信徒都看到了国王，可是国王却看不见她们。这时候酒神狄俄尼
索斯对着山谷大喊一声：" 妇女们，他就是嘲笑我们神圣教仪的人，惩罚他吧！
" 森林里没有一片树叶颤动，没有任何生物的声音。巴克科斯的信徒们抬起头来，
她们听到了教主呼唤的声音，顿时飞快地奔跑起来。仿佛来自神}的差遣，在狂
欢中她们穿过湍急的河流和密密的丛林，终于走近了，看到坐在树顶上的仇人，
她们的国王。她们先是扔石块、折断的树枝和神杖。可是这些东西都扔不到国王
所在的树冠上。后来她们用坚硬的栎树棒挖掘松树周围的泥土，刨出了树根。大
树轰隆一声倒了下来，彭透斯和树身一起栽倒在地上。酒神在彭透斯的母亲阿高
厄双眼上画了符，所以她认不出自己的儿子。现在她首当其冲，做了一个惩罚的
手势。这时国王大惊失色，突然恢复了知觉，高喊一声" 母亲" ，想扑进母亲的
怀抱。" 你还认识你的儿子吗？我是彭透斯，是你在厄喀翁家时生的儿子。可怜
我吧，千万别惩罚你的孩子！" 但这位巴克科斯狂热的女信徒，却口吐白沫，斜
着眼睛看着他，没有认出他是自己的亲生儿子，她所看见的只是一头凶狠的野狮。

    她一把抓住儿子的肩膀，猛地拉断他的右臂。她的姐妹们蜂拥而上，拉下了
国王的右臂。一群妇女疯狂地奔上前来，七手八脚，每人从他身上撕下一块皮肉。
阿高厄又伸出血淋淋的双手，紧紧地拧住儿子的脑袋，将它穿在她的神杖上，仍
然以为那是一个巨大的狮子头，并且带着它兴奋地穿过基太隆的树林。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事9 ：珀耳修斯

    施瓦布

    珀耳修斯是宙斯的儿子，出生后，他的外祖父阿克里西俄斯，即亚各斯国王，
将珀耳修斯和他的母亲达那厄装在一只箱子里，投入大海。因为一种神谕告诉国
王：他的外孙将会夺取他的王位并谋害他的生命。宙斯保佑着在大海中漂流的母
子，引导这只箱子穿过风浪，最后箱子一直漂到塞里福斯岛，靠近了海岸。岛上
有两位兄弟，狄克堤斯和波吕得克忒斯，他们统治着塞里福斯岛。狄克堤斯正在
海边捕鱼，他看到水里漂来一只木箱，就连忙把它拉上海岸。回到家中，兄弟二
人对遭遗弃的落难人十分同情，便收留了他们。波吕得克忒斯娶达那厄为妻，并
悉心地抚育珀耳修斯。　　珀耳修斯长大成人后，他的继父波吕得克忒斯劝他外
出去冒险，并希望他能够建功立业。勇敢的小伙子雄心勃勃，决心砍下女妖墨杜
萨那颗丑恶的脑袋，把它带到塞里福斯，交给国王。　　珀耳修斯整理完行装就
上路了。诸神引导他一直来到了远方，那是可怕的众怪之父福耳库斯居住的地方。

    珀耳修斯在那里遇到了福耳库斯的三个女儿：格赖埃。她们生下来就是满头
白发，三个人只有一只眼睛，一颗牙齿，彼此轮流使用。珀耳修斯夺走了她们的
牙齿和眼睛。她们要求归还她们这些不可缺少的东西。他提出一个条件，要她们
指明到仙女那儿去的道路。这些仙女都会魔法，有几样宝物：一双飞鞋，一只神
袋，一顶狗皮盔。无论谁，有了这些东西，就可以随心所欲地自由飞翔，看到愿
意看到的人，而别人却看不见他。福耳库斯的女儿们给珀耳修斯指路，并且讨回
了自己的眼睛和牙齿。　　到了仙女那里，珀耳修斯得到了三件宝贝。他背上神
袋，穿上飞鞋，戴上狗皮盔。此外，他又从赫耳墨斯那里得到一副青铜盾。他用
这些神物把自己武装起来，向大海那边飞了过去。那里住着福耳库斯的另外三位
女儿，即戈耳工。在三个女儿中小女儿墨杜萨是凡胎，珀耳修斯就是奉命来取她
的脑袋的。珀耳修斯发现戈耳工们正睡觉。她们的头上布满了鳞甲，没有头发，
头上盘着一条条毒蛇。她们长着公猪的獠牙，她们有双铁手，还有金翅膀，任何
人看到她们都会立即变成石头。珀耳修斯知道这个秘密。他背过脸去，不看熟睡
中的女人，然后用光亮的盾牌作镜子，清楚地看出她们的三个头像，并认出了谁
是墨杜萨。雅典娜又指点他怎样动手，所以他顺利地割下了女妖的头。　　珀耳
修斯还没有收起刀，突然从女妖身躯里跳出一匹双翼的飞马珀伽索斯，后面又紧
跟着一位巨人克律萨俄耳，他们都是波塞冬的后代。珀耳修斯小心地把墨杜萨的
头颅塞在背上的神袋里，离开了那里。这时候，墨杜萨的姐姐们从床上坐了起来。
她们看见了被杀死的妹妹的尸体，便立刻展开翅膀，飞到空中追赶凶手。可是珀
耳修斯戴着仙女的狗皮盔，躲过了跟踪和追捕。不过他在空中也遇到了狂风袭击，
被吹得左右摇晃。当他摇摆着经过利比亚沙漠时，从墨杜萨的脑袋上滴下的点点
鲜血，一直落到地上，变成了各种颜色的毒蛇，世界上许多地方从此以后就有了
危险的蛇类。　　珀耳修斯继续向西飞行，最后在国王阿特拉斯的国土上降落下
来，想休息一会儿。这里有一片丛林，树上结着金果，旁边守卫着一条巨龙。珀
耳修斯请求让他在这儿住一夜，但没有得到允许。因为阿特拉斯担心他的金果被
盗，所以狠心地把珀耳修斯逐出了宫殿。珀耳修斯十分愤怒，当场从神袋中掏出
墨杜萨的头颅，自己却背过身子，把头颅向国王递了过去。国王身材高大，如同
一位巨人。他看到墨杜萨的头后立即变作一块巨石，简直像一座大山，他的胡须
和头发变成了广阔的森林，肩膀、手臂和大腿变成了山脊，头颅变成高高的山峰。

    珀耳修斯重新系上飞鞋，戴上头盔，背上神袋飞上高空。他一路飞行，来到
埃塞俄比亚的海岸边，这是国王刻甫斯治理的地方。珀耳修斯看到耸立在大海之
中的山岩上捆绑着一个年轻的姑娘。海风吹乱了她的头发，姑娘泪流不止。珀耳
修斯为她的年轻美貌所动心，便跟她打起招呼。" 你为什么捆绑在这里？你叫什
么名字，家住哪里？" 　　姑娘反背着双手，起初沉默不语，害怕同一个陌生人
说话。假如她能动弹，真想用双手蒙住脸。为了不使陌生人造成错觉，以为她真
的做了什么见不得人的事，所以她噙着眼泪，回答说：" 我叫安德洛墨达，是埃
塞俄比亚国王刻甫斯的女儿。我的母亲曾吹嘘，说我比海神涅柔斯的女儿，即海
洋的女仙们更漂亮。海洋女仙们十分愤怒。她们共有姐妹五十人，一起请海神发
大水淹没了整个国家。海神还派了一个妖怪，吞没了陆上的一切。神谕宣示：如
果想使国家得到解救，必须把我，国王的女儿丢给妖怪喂食。国民顿时闹得沸沸
扬扬，纷纷要求我的父亲献出女儿，拯救全国。绝望之余，国王只好下令将我锁
在这里。" 　　姑娘的话刚刚讲完，滔天的海浪滚滚而来。海水中冒出了一个妖
怪，宽宽的胸膛盖住了整个水面。姑娘一见，吓得发出一声尖叫，她的父母亲也
赶紧走来。他们看到女儿大祸临头，万分绝望，母亲因内疚流露出痛苦的神情。
他们紧紧地抱着捆绑着的女儿，却无能为力，救不了女儿。　　这时珀耳修斯说
：" 你们要哭，将来有的是时间；眼下，当务之急是救人。我叫珀耳修斯，是宙
斯和达那厄的儿子。我战胜了墨杜萨。神的翅膀让我飞越高空。姑娘如果是自由
的，并愿意挑选配偶的话，她一定会首先看中我。但像她现在这个样子，我却要
向她正式求婚，并愿意前去搭救她。你们愿意接受我的条件吗？" 父母庆幸遇到
了救星，连连点头，不仅答应把女儿许配给他，还答应把王国送给他作为嫁妆。

    说话间妖怪已经游了过来，只有一箭之地了。年轻人见状便用脚往上一蹬，
腾空而起。妖怪看到他在海面上投下的身影，便狂怒地向影子追去，像是意识到
有人要抢走它的猎物似的。珀耳修斯犹如一只矫健的雄鹰，从空中猛扑下来。他
用杀死墨杜萨的利剑狠狠地刺进妖怪的背部，只有剑柄露在外面。他把剑拔出来，
妖怪疼得蹿到空中，然后又沉入水底，疯狂地挣扎着。珀耳修斯一再朝它身上刺
杀，直到它的口中涌出了黑血。这时，它的翅膀也沾湿了，他不敢在空中久留。
恰好水面上露出一块礁石，他便扇动翅膀轻轻地落在岩壁上，然后又用剑在妖怪
的肚子里搅动了三四次。海浪飘走了它的尸体，不久它就从海面消失了。珀耳修
斯飞到岸边，登上山顶，解开姑娘的锁链，把她交给不幸的父母亲。他受到隆重
的款待，成了宫廷里的贵客佳婿。　　正当婚礼在欢乐地举行时，王宫的前厅里
突然骚动起来，并传来一声沉闷的吼声。原来国王刻甫斯的弟弟菲纽斯带了一批
武士闯了进来。他从前曾经追求过安德洛墨达，在她危难时却舍弃了她。现在他
来重申自己的要求。菲纽斯挥舞着长矛闯进婚礼大厅，并朝着惊讶的珀耳修斯大
声叫喊：" 我在这里，你抢走了我的未婚妻，我要报仇。无论你的宝物或者你的
父亲宙斯都无法保护你！" 说着，他摆开架势，准备把长矛扔过来。　　刻甫斯
从席间站起来。" 你疯了！" 他喝斥道，" 不是珀耳修斯抢去了你的未婚妻。当
我们被迫牺牲她时，你看着她被绑在那里，你为什么不亲自去救她，却袖手旁观
呢？

    " 　　菲纽斯回答不出，他死死盯住他的兄弟和情敌，好像在思考先从哪一
个下手。终于，他在疯狂中用尽全力，朝珀耳修斯掷出他的矛。可是他的眼力不
好，长矛一下子扎进垫子里。珀耳修斯乘机跳了起来，朝门口投出他的标枪，标
枪直朝菲纽斯飞去。要不是菲纽斯蹦跳到祭坛后面，标枪肯定会穿透他的胸脯。
虽然菲纽斯躲过了，但他的一名随从却被刺中了前额，这下武士们全拥了上来，
和参加婚礼的客人打成了一团。闯进来武士人多势盛，把珀耳修斯国王夫妇和新
婚妻子团团围住。箭如飞蝗，从各个方向射过来。珀耳修斯背靠一根大柱，招架
敌人，奋力阻止他们前进，杀死了一个又一个进犯的敌人。后来，他看到自己单
凭勇力已经不起作用，于是决定拿出最后的一招。" 我也是被逼得没有办法了，
" 他说，" 我只好叫过去的仇敌帮助我了。请我的朋友都转过脸去！" 说完，他
从神袋里取出墨杜萨的头，朝着逼近的对手伸了过去。对手正盲目地向着这里冲
过来。" 让你的魔法去吓唬别人吧，" 他一边冲，一边蔑视地大喊，" 他们才会
被你的鬼话吓倒。" 可是，他刚举手投矛时，手却举在空中僵硬住了。后面的人
也一个个难逃变成石头的厄运。这时候，珀耳修斯干脆把墨杜萨的首级高高地举
起，让别的人都能立即看见。他用这种办法把最后的一批人变成了僵硬的石块。
直到这时，菲纽斯才后悔不该这样无理取闹，挑起事端。他看着左右两面姿态不
同的石像，呼喊着朋友们的名字，但没有一个回答。他不相信似地用手触摸他们
的躯体，然而他们都已变成了花岗岩。他惊恐万分，一改往日的骄横，绝望地哀
求着：" 饶我的命吧！王国和新妇都给你！" 说完他转过身子。可是珀耳修斯不
想宽恕他。

    " 你这个贼徒，" 他怒骂道，" 我将在岳父的宫殿里为你永远树立一座纪念
碑！

    " 　　菲纽斯左躲右闪，不想看到那可怕的头颅，可是它终于没有躲过。顿
时，菲纽斯神色恐怖地变成了石头，站在那里，双手下垂，完全是一副卑贱的奴
仆模样。　　珀耳修斯终于能够带着年轻的妻子安德洛墨达回乡了。长久幸福的
日子在等待着他。他还找到了母亲达那厄。但他仍不能避免给外祖父阿克里西俄
斯带来灾难。外祖父由于害怕神谕，悄悄地逃亡外地，到了彼拉斯齐国王那儿。
当时，这里正在举行比武。他不知道外祖父就在这里，还准备去亚各斯问候外祖
父。珀耳修斯看到比武十分高兴，他抓过一块铁饼扔出去，不幸正好打中了外祖
父。不久，他就知道了他所杀害的人是谁。他深深哀痛死者，把他安葬在城外，
并且交换了他所继承的王国。从此以后命运之神再也不妒嫉他了。安德洛墨达给
他生了一群可爱的儿子，他们一直保持住父亲的荣誉。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事10：伊翁

    施瓦布

    雅典的国王厄瑞克透斯有一个漂亮的女儿，名叫克瑞乌萨。她事先没有征得
国王同意便成了太阳神阿波罗的新妇，并为他生了一个儿子。由于害怕父亲生气，
她把孩子藏在一只箱子里，放在她跟太阳神幽会的山洞里。她虔诚地希望众神会
可怜这个被遗弃的儿子。为了使儿子身上有个辨认的标记，她把自己当姑娘时佩
戴的首饰挂在孩子的身上。儿子出世的事自然瞒不过阿波罗。他既不想辜负他的
情人，又不想让自己的孩子落到无依无靠的地步，于是他找到他的兄弟赫耳墨斯。

    作为神}的使者，赫耳墨斯可以在天地之间自由来往，不受阻拦。" 亲爱的
兄弟，" 阿波罗说，" 有一位凡间女子给我生下了一个孩子，她是雅典国王厄瑞
克透斯的女儿。因为畏惧父亲，她把孩子藏在一个山洞里。请你帮帮我，救下这
个孩子，把用麻布包着的孩子连同箱子送到我在特尔斐的神殿，放在神殿的门槛
上，其余的事情由我去办，因为他是我的儿子。" 　　赫耳墨斯展开双翅，飞到
雅典，在阿波罗指定的地方找到了孩子，然后把他放在柳条箱里，背到特尔斐，
按照阿波罗的吩咐，放在神殿的门槛上，并且掀开盖子，以便让人容易发现他。
这些事情是在夜里做完的。　　第二天早晨，当太阳升起的时候，特尔斐的女祭
司走向神殿，突然发现睡在小箱子里的婴儿。她估猜这是一个私生子，便想把他
从门槛上搬走。可是神}却使她的内心产生了一股怜悯之情。女祭司把孩子从筐
内抱起来，带在自己的身边扶育他，尽管她不知道谁是孩子的父母亲。孩子一天
天长大，终日在父亲的神坛前玩耍，却不知道父母亲是谁。他渐渐长成一个高大
英俊的少年。

    特尔斐的居民都把他看作神庙的小守护者，都很喜欢他，让他看管献给神}
的祭品。于是他在父亲的神殿里高高兴兴地生活着。　　克瑞乌萨从此以后再也
没有听到太阳神阿波罗的消息，以为他早已将她和儿子忘掉了。这时，雅典人与
邻国的欧俾阿岛的居民发生激烈的战事。最后欧俾阿人失败了。雅典人取得了战
争的胜利，他们尤其感谢从阿开亚来的一位外乡人的帮助。他是希腊人的祖先赫
楞的儿子，名叫克素托斯，是丢卡利翁的后代。他要求国王的女儿克瑞乌萨嫁给
他，他的要求得到了同意。好像这件事激怒了太阳神，为了惩罚她，她一直没有
生育。

    若干年后，克瑞乌萨想去特尔斐神殿求子。其实这正是阿波罗的意思，他是
决不会忘掉自己的儿子的。克瑞乌萨公主和他的丈夫带着一群仆人动身了。他们
要去特尔斐神殿朝贡，一行人来达神殿时，阿波罗的儿子正跨过门槛，用桂花树
枝装饰门框。他看见了这位高贵的夫人，她一见神殿就禁不住掉泪。他小心翼翼
地问她为什么悲哀。　　" 我不想了解你的伤心事，" 他说，" 不过，如果你愿
意的话，请告诉我，你是谁，从什么地方来？" 　　" 我叫克瑞乌萨，" 公主回
答说，" 我的父亲是厄瑞克透斯，雅典是我的故国家乡。" 　　这青年一听，高
兴地喊了起来：" 那是多么有名的地方，你的出身是多么高贵！不过，请告诉我，
那是真的吗？我们从图画上看到，你的曾祖父厄里克托尼俄斯像棵庄稼一样，是
从地里长出来的。雅典娜女神将泥土所生的孩子放在箱子里，让两条巨龙看守着，
然后将箱子交给刻克洛帕斯的女儿去保护。听说那些女儿抑制不住好奇心，悄悄
地打开箱盖。等到她们看到男孩时却突然发了疯，从刻克洛帕斯城堡的山岩上跳
了下去。　　这难道也是真的？" 　　克瑞乌萨默默地点点头，因为她那祖先的
遭遇使她想起了自己弃婴的事。儿子正站在面前，无拘无束地继续问着：" 你的
父亲厄瑞克透斯真的因为地裂而被吞没？波塞冬真的用三叉戟杀害了他？他的坟
墓真的就在我所供奉的主人阿波罗所喜欢的那座山洞附近吗？" 　　" 陌生的年
轻人啊，请你别提起那座山洞，" 克瑞乌萨打断他的话，" 那里是发生不忠诚和
重大罪孽的地方。" 公主沉默了一会，又振作了精神，把年轻人看作神殿的守护
者，告诉他说，自己是克素托斯王子的妻子，她同他前来特尔斐，祈求神}赐给
她一个儿子。" 福玻斯。阿波罗知道我没有孩子的原因，" 她叹息着说，" 只有
他才能帮助我。" 　　" 你没有儿子，是个不幸的人吗？" 年轻人同情而又伤心
问了一句。　　" 我早就是个不幸的人了，" 克瑞乌萨回答说，" 我非常羡慕你
的母亲，能够有你这么一个聪明伶俐的儿子。""我不知道谁是我的母亲和父亲，
" 年轻人悲伤地说，" 我也不知道我是从哪里来的。我的养母曾经对我说，她是
神殿的女祭司，对我十分同情，抱养了我。从此以后，我就住在神殿里，我是神
}的仆人。" 　　公主听到这话，心里怦然一动。她沉思了一会，又把思想转了
回来，心疼地说：" 我认识一个妇人，她的命运跟你的母亲一样。我是为了她的
缘故，才来这里祈求神谕的。跟我一起过来的还有她的丈夫，他为了听取特洛福
尼俄斯的神谕，特地绕道过去了。趁他没有到，我愿意把那位女人的秘密告诉你，
因为你是神的仆人。那位夫人说过，在她和现在的这个丈夫结婚之前曾经跟伟大
的神福玻斯。阿波罗交往甚密。她没有征求父亲的意见便跟阿波罗生了一个儿子。
女人将孩子遗弃了，从此就不知道他的音讯。为了在神}面前打听她的儿子是活
着还是死了，我代那位女人亲自赶到这里。" 　　" 这是多少年前的事情？" 年
轻人问。　　" 如果他还活着，那么跟你同龄。" 克瑞乌萨说。　　" 你的那位
女友的命运跟我的多么相似啊！" 年轻人悲伤地叫道，" 她寻找自己的儿子，我
寻找自己的母亲。而这一切都发生在一个遥远的国度里，只是我们彼此又不相识。

    可是你别指望香炉前的神}会给你一个满意的答复。因为你用你朋友的名义
控诉他的不义，而神}是不会自己认错的！""别说了！" 克瑞乌萨打断他的话，
" 那位女人的丈夫过来了。我向你吐露的秘密你千万别让他知道。" 　　克素托
斯高高兴兴地跨进神殿，向他的妻子走来。　　" 特洛福尼俄斯给了我一个吉利
的消息，他说我不会不带着一个孩子回去的。咦！这位年轻的祭司是谁？" 克素
托斯问。　　年轻人走上一步，谦恭地回答说，他只是阿波罗神殿的仆人。这里
是特尔斐人最敬重的圣地，而那些命运之签所挑中的人却在里面，他们围着三脚
香炉，听取女祭司从那里宣示神谕。克素托斯听到这话，立即吩咐克瑞乌萨，跟
前来求取神谕的人一样，赶紧用花枝装饰自己，在阿波罗的祭坛前朝神}祈祷，
祈求神}赐给他们一个吉利的神谕。克瑞乌萨看到露天祭坛上放着桂花树环便走
过去，克素托斯连忙走进圣殿的里间，那位年轻人仍在前庭守护着。　　不一会
儿，年轻人听到丝殿内间的门开启的声音，接着又看见克素托斯王子兴冲冲地走
了出来。

    他突然狂热地抱住守在门外的年轻人，连声叫他" 儿子" ，要求他也拥抱自
己，给自己送上一个儿子的吻。年轻人不知道发生了什么事，以为他疯了，便冷
漠地用力将他推开。可是克素托斯并不在乎。" 神已亲自给我启示，" 他说，"
神谕宣示：我走出门来遇到的第一个人便是我的儿子。这是神}的一种赐予。这
是什么原因，我并不明白，因为我的妻子从来没有替我生过孩子。可是我相信神
灵的话，他也许会亲自给我阐明的。" 　　听完这话，年轻人也不由得高兴起来，
不过他还有些不知足。当他承受着父亲的拥抱和亲吻时，悲叹道：" 呵，亲爱的
母亲，你在哪里呢？你是谁呢？我什么时间才能见到你仁慈的面孔呢？" 这时候，
他心里又产生一丝疑虑，他不知道克素托斯的妻子是否愿意认他为儿子，因为她
没有亲生的孩子，也不认识他。此外，雅典城会不会接受这位不合法的王子呢？

    他的父亲竭力安慰他，答应不在雅典人和妻子面前认他为儿子，他给他起了
一个名字，叫伊翁，即漫游天涯海角的人。　　这时，克瑞乌萨还在阿波罗的祭
坛前祈祷，一动也不动。但她的祈祷突然被女仆们的喧嚷声打断了，她们跑来抱
怨道：" 不幸的女主人啊，你的丈夫满怀喜悦，可是你却永远得不到一个儿子，
抱在怀里。阿波罗赐给你丈夫一个儿子，一个已经长大成人的儿子。可能是从前
他和另外一个女人生的。他从神殿里走出来的时候正好遇到了儿子。他为重新找
到自己的孩子而高兴。" 　　神}没有让公主的心灵开窍，她竟未能看穿近在身
旁的秘密，仍在继续为自己悲哀的命运而烦恼。过了一会，她鼓起勇气，打听这
位突如其来的儿子叫什么名字。" 他是守护神殿的那个年轻人，你见过他，" 女
佣们回答，" 他的父亲给他起了个名字叫伊翁。我们不知道谁是他的母亲。你的
丈夫现在到巴克科斯祭坛去了。他想悄悄地为他的儿子给神献祭，然后在那里举
行一个庄严的宴会。他严肃地吩咐我们，别把这件事告诉你。可是我们出于对你
的爱护，违抗了他的命令。你可千万别说是我们告诉你的！" 　　这时，从众人
中间走出一个老仆人，他一心忠于厄瑞克透斯家族，并对女主人十分忠诚。他认
为克素托斯国王是不忠实的丈夫，愤怒而又妒嫉地出主意，要消灭这个私生子，
以免他继承厄瑞克透斯的王位。克瑞乌萨想着自己已被丈夫和从前的情人，即阿
波罗所遗弃，感到悲愤难忍，就同意了老仆人的阴谋，并对他讲明了她从前跟太
阳神的关系。　　克素托斯跟伊翁离开神殿后，他们一起登上巴那萨斯的山顶，
那是祭祀巴克科斯神的地方。王子在这里浇酒在地祭祀之后，伊翁在仆人的帮助
下在旷野上搭了一座华丽的帐篷，上面盖着他从阿波罗神庙里带来的精美的花毯。
里面摆了长桌。桌上放满了装有丰盛食品的银盘和斟满名酒的金杯，排场豪华。
雅典人克素托斯派使者到特尔斐城，邀请所有的居民前来参加盛宴。不久，帐篷
里挤满了头戴花环的贵客。在饭后用点心的时候，走出一位老人，他那奇怪的姿
态引得客人们哈哈大笑。老人走进帐篷，为宾客们敬酒。克素托斯认出他是妻子
克瑞乌萨的老仆人，于是当着客人的面夸奖他的勤奋和忠诚，大家也称赞他慈祥
善良。老人站在酒柜前，侍候客人。等到宴会终席，笛声吹起时，他连忙吩咐仆
人，撤去小杯，摆上金银大碗，好像要给年轻的新主人斟酒。果然老人走近酒柜，
满满地倒了一碗酒。他趁人不注意时将金碗轻轻晃了晃，碗内放着置人死命的毒
药。

    老人悄悄地来到伊翁身旁往地上滴了几滴烈酒，算是祭祀。这时候只听见旁
边站着的一个仆人不在意地骂了一句。伊翁是在神殿里长大的，知道在神圣的教
仪中这是一种不祥的预兆，于是便把杯里的酒全倒在地上，并吩咐仆人重新给他
递上一只杯子斟上酒，然后用这杯酒进行隆重的浇祭仪式。客人们全都跟他这样
做。

    这时，外面飞进来一群圣鸽，它们都是在阿波罗神殿里长大的。鸽子飞进帐
篷后看到地上全是浇祭的美酒，都飞下去争相抢饮。别的鸽子喝过祭酒后都安然
无恙，只有饮过伊翁倒掉的第一杯酒的那只鸽子拍扇着翅膀，摇晃着发出一阵哀
鸣，不一会儿抽搐而死。　　伊翁愤怒地从椅子上站了起来，紧握双拳，大声叫
道：" 是谁竟想谋害我？老头子，你说！是你在酒里搀了毒药，把杯子给了我。
" 他一把抓住老人，不让他逃脱，老人出人意料地承认了这件罪行，但把罪过推
在克瑞乌萨的身上。听了这话，伊翁离开帐篷，客人们个个义愤填膺，一齐跟在
后面。

    在外面空地上，他对着天空高举双手，朝着四周围着他的特尔斐贵客说："
神圣的大地哟，你可以为我作证，这个异国的女子竟然想用毒药除掉我！" 　　
" 用石头打死她！用石头打死她！" 周围的人异口同声地喊道，并跟着伊翁一起
去寻找罪恶的女子。克素托斯随着人流，不知道到底该怎么办。　　克瑞乌萨在
阿波罗的祭坛旁等待着罪恶阴谋的结果，可是，结果却出乎她的意料之外。远处
的嘈杂声把她从沉思中惊得跳了起来。她还不知道外面是怎么一回事时，她丈夫
身旁一名忠实于她的仆人急匆匆地抢先跑了进来，特地赶来告诉她阴谋已经败露，
特尔斐人要来找她算帐。听到这个消息，克瑞乌萨的女仆人一齐将她围了起来保
护她。" 女主人，你必须紧紧抓住祭坛，别松开，" 她们说，" 如果这个圣地不
能让你免遭杀害，那么他们所犯的杀人流血的罪行，也是不可饶恕的。" 正在这
时，一群暴怒的人在伊翁的率领下已经越来越近。风中传来了他的讲话声：" 诸
神啊，向我大发慈悲吧，他们告诉我是继母对我下了毒手。她十分憎恨我，她在
那里呀？

    你们一齐动手，把她从最高的山顶上推下去吧！" 　　他们来到祭坛旁。伊
翁抓住这个女人，他不知道她正是他的生母，却把她看作不共戴天的死敌；他想
拖着她离开祭坛，而神圣的祭坛成了她不可侵犯的避难所。阿波罗不愿看到自己
的儿子成为杀死生母的凶手。他把神谕暗示给女祭司，让她明白了事情的原委，
知道她领养的孩子不是克素托斯的儿子，而是阿波罗和克瑞乌萨的儿子。她离开
了三足圣坛，找出她从前在殿门口找到的盛放婴儿的小箱子，匆忙来到祭坛前，
看到克瑞乌萨在伊翁的拉扯下正拼命挣扎。伊翁看到女祭司，连忙虔诚地迎上去。
" 欢迎你，亲爱的母亲，尽管你没有生我，可是我却愿意叫你母亲！你听说我刚
刚逃脱了一场祸事吗？我才得到了父亲，他的妻子却策划谋杀我！" 女祭司听后
警告他说：" 伊翁，请以一双干干净净的手回到雅典去！" 伊翁沉思了一会，寻
找着合适的回答：" 杀掉自己的敌人难道没有道理吗？""在我把话讲完以前，你
千万别动手！" 仁慈的女祭司说，" 你看到这只小箱子了吗？你就是装在箱子里
被遗弃在这儿的。" 　　" 这只小箱子跟我有什么相干？" 伊翁问。　　" 里面
还有包裹你的麻布呢，亲爱的孩子。" 女祭司说。" 包裹我的麻布？" 伊翁惊叫
起来，" 这是一条线索，它可以帮助我找到我的生母。" 　　女祭司给他递上开
着的小箱子，伊翁热情地伸过手去，从里面取出一堆小心折叠着的麻布。他含着
泪，悲伤地端量着这些宝贵的纪念物。克瑞乌萨也渐渐地恢复镇静，她一眼看到
伊翁手里的麻布和小箱子，明白了真情。她跳起身来离开了祭坛，高兴地叫起来
：" 我的儿啊！" 她说完便伸出双手紧紧抱住惊异不已的伊翁。伊翁却满腹狐疑
地看着她，不情愿地挣脱了身子。克瑞乌萨往后退了几步，说：" 这块麻布将证
实我的话。孩子！你把它摊开，就能找到我当年给你做的标记。这块布的中间画
着戈耳工的头，四周围着毒蛇，如同盾牌一样。" 伊翁半信半疑地打开麻布，突
然惊喜地叫了起来：" 呵，伟大的宙斯，这是戈耳工，这儿是毒蛇！" 　　" 箱
子里还有一条金龙项链，" 克瑞乌萨继续说，" 是用来纪念厄里克托尼俄斯箱子
里的巨龙的。这是送给婴儿挂在脖子上的首饰。" 　　伊翁在箱子里又搜索了一
阵，幸福地微笑着，他找到了金龙项链。　　" 最后一个信物，" 克瑞乌萨说，
" 是橄榄叶花环，这是用从雅典橄榄树上摘下来的橄榄叶编成的，是我把它戴在
新生儿的头上的。" 　　伊翁伸手在箱子底又搜索了一阵，果然找到一个美丽的
橄榄叶花环。" 母亲，母亲！" 他呼喊着，哽咽着，一把抱住母亲的脖子，在她
的面颊上连连吻着。最后他松开了手，想去寻找父亲克素托斯。这时，克瑞乌萨
对他说出了他出生的秘密，说他就是在那座神殿里忠诚地侍候了那么多年的阿波
罗神的儿子。　　克素托斯把伊翁看作神}恩赐的宝贝。三人都到阿波罗神殿里，
感谢神恩。女祭司坐在三足祭坛上给他们预示，伊翁将成为一个大族的祖先，即
爱奥尼亚人的祖先。　　克素托斯和克瑞乌萨满怀喜悦和希望，带着重新找到的
儿子返回雅典，特尔斐城的居民都出门夹道欢送。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事11：代达罗斯和伊卡洛斯

    施瓦布

    雅典的代达罗斯是墨提翁的儿子，厄瑞克透斯的曾孙，也是厄瑞克族人。他
是一位伟大的艺术家，是位建筑师和雕刻家。世界各地的人都十分赞赏他的艺术
品，说他的雕像是具有灵魂的创造物，因为从前的大师创作石像时，都让石像闭
上眼睛，双手连着身体，无力地垂落下来。而他第一个让雕刻的人像张开眼睛，
往前伸出双手，并迈开双腿好像走路一样。可是，代达罗斯却是一个爱虚荣和爱
妒嫉的人。这一缺点诱使他作恶，使他陷于悲惨的境地。　　代达罗斯有个外甥，
名叫塔洛斯。塔洛斯向他学艺，而他的天分比代达罗斯高，并立志作出更大的成
就。还在儿童时代，塔洛斯就已经发明了陶工旋盘，他用蛇的颌骨作为锯子，用
锯齿锯断一块小木板。后来，他又依样造了一把铁锯，从而成为锯子的发明者。

    他还发明了圆规。起初，他们两根铁棒连结起来，然后让其中一根固定位置，
让另一根旋转。他是个善于动脑筋的人，还发明了别的巧妙的工具。而这一切都
是他独立完成的，没有他舅舅的帮助。因而他出了名，赢得了很大的声誉。代达
罗斯担心他的学生会超过他，一股嫉妒的怒火油然而生，竟阴险地把他从雅典城
墙上推了下去，残酷地杀害了自己的学生。代达罗斯埋葬尸体的时候，十分惊恐，
慌里慌张，被人发现了，他谎称在埋一条蛇。可是他仍被指控谋杀，受到希腊雅
典最高法院的传唤和审讯。结果被判有罪。　　但他逃脱了，在惊慌之中，在阿
提喀迷失了方向，流浪多时，最后来到克里特岛。他找到国王弥诺斯，并在那里
住下来。他成为国王的朋友，被当作有名望的艺术家受到极大的尊重。国王委派
他给牛头人身的巨怪弥诺陶洛斯建造一所住宅，要让进去的人都感到晕头转向，
迷失方向。代达罗斯头脑灵活，尽心建造了一座迷宫。里面迂回曲折，使进去的
人不由得眼花缭乱，双脚不由自主地走到岔道上去。无数的过道互相交错，犹如
夫利基阿的密安得河迂回的河水，一会儿顺流，一会儿倒流，又回到它的源头。

    迷宫造好后，代达罗斯走进去察看，连自己也几乎找不到出口处。弥诺陶洛
斯就深藏在迷宫的深处。根据古老的规定，雅典城每九年必须给克里特国王送上
七名童男童女，作为进贡弥诺陶洛斯的祭品。　　代达罗斯虽然受到赞誉，但因
离家日久，总是怀着对家乡的眷恋之情，而且他感觉到国王其实并不信任他，对
他缺乏真诚，因此他不愿意在这个孤岛上虚度一生。他想设法逃走。久经考虑后，
他高兴地说，弥诺斯虽然可以从陆上和水上封住我的去路，但在空中我是畅通无
阻的。他开始收集整理大大小小的羽毛，把最小最短的羽毛拼成长毛，看上去像
天生的一般。他把羽毛用麻线在中间捆住，在末端用腊封牢。最后，把羽毛微微
弯曲，看起来完全像鸟翼一样。　　代达罗斯有一个儿子叫伊卡洛斯。这孩子喜
欢站在他的身旁，用一双小手帮父亲劳动。父亲听凭他在一旁随意地摆弄羽毛，
微笑地看着他的笨拙的动作。终于一切都完成了。代达罗斯把翅膀缚在身上试了
试。

    他像鸟一样飞了起来，轻轻地升上云天，然后重新降落下来。他又指教儿子
伊卡洛斯如何操纵。他已给他做了一对小羽翼。" 你要当心，" 他叮嘱道，" 必
须在半空中飞行。你如果飞得太低，羽翼会碰到海水，沾湿了会变得沉重，你就
会被拽在大海里；要是飞得太高，翅膀上的羽毛会因靠近太阳而着火。" 代达罗
斯一边说，一边把羽翼给儿子缚在他的双肩上，但他的手却在微微地发抖。最后，
他拥抱着儿子，还给了他一个鼓励的吻。　　两个人鼓起翅膀渐渐地升上了天空。

    父亲飞在前头，他像带着初次出巢的雏鸟飞行的老鸟一样，小心地扇着翅膀，
不时地回过头来，看儿子飞行得怎样。开始时一切都很顺利。不久他们就到达萨
玛岛上空，随后又飞过了提洛斯和培罗斯。伊卡洛斯兴高采烈，他感到飞行很轻
快，不由得骄傲起来。于是，他操纵着羽翼朝高空飞去，可是惩罚也终于飞来了！
太阳强烈的阳光融化了封蜡，用蜡封在一起的羽毛开始松动。伊卡洛斯还没有发
现，羽翼已经完全散开，从他的双肩上滚落下去。不幸的孩子只得用两手在空中
绝望地划动，可是他浮不起来，一头栽落下去，最后掉在汪洋大海中，万顷碧波
把他淹没了。这一切发生得很突然，瞬间便结束了，代达罗斯根本没有觉察到。
当他再次回过头来时，没有看见他的儿子。" 伊卡洛斯，伊卡洛斯！" 他预感不
妙，大声呼喊起来，" 你在哪里？我到哪里才能找到你？" 最后，他惊恐地朝下
面瞅了一眼。他看到海面上漂着许多羽毛。代达罗斯连忙收住羽翼，降落在一座
海岛上，将羽翼放在一边，他张大眼睛，满怀希望地寻找着。一会儿，汹涌的海
浪把他儿子的尸体推上了海岸。天哪！被他杀害的塔洛斯以此报了仇雪了恨！绝
望的父亲掩埋了儿子的尸体。为纪念他的儿子，从此，埋葬伊卡洛斯尸体的海岛
叫做伊卡利亚。　　代达罗斯怀着悲痛，又继续飞行。他飞向西西里岛，这里是
国王科卡罗斯统治的地方。就像从前在克里特岛上受到弥诺斯的款待一样，他在
这里也受到盛情接待，被当作贵客。他的艺术天才使当地居民十分惊喜。他在那
里兴修水利，造了人工湖泊，又把湖水顺着河流一直送到附近的大海。在陡峭的
山峦顶上，有一块无法攀登冲击的险要地方，连树木也难生长，他在上面建造了
一座坚固的城池，修筑了一条羊肠小道盘旋而上，直到山顶。这样的城堡只要三、
四个人就可以守护，固若磐石。科卡罗斯国王选择这座难以攻克的城堡存放他的
珍宝。代达罗斯在西西里岛上完成的第三件工程是在地面上挖一座深洞。他从洞
里巧妙地引取地下火的热气，所以，即使一座潮湿的岩洞，现在也舒适得如同暖
室，好像岩洞里安了取暖设备一样，人在慢慢地出汗，却又不嫌太热。此外，他
还扩建了厄里克斯山上的阿佛洛狄忒神庙，给女神献祭了一只金蜂房。代达罗斯
精心雕刻，那些小蜂窝几乎达到乱真的地步，跟天然的蜂窝一模一样。　　国王
弥诺斯听说代达罗斯逃到西西里岛，非常恼怒，决心派出强大的部队，把他重新
抢回来。他装备了一支舰队，从克里特一直驶往西西里岛。他的军队上岛以后驻
扎下来，然后他派出使者前往京城，要求国王科卡罗斯交出逃亡的代达罗斯。科
卡罗斯听了这异邦君主的蛮横的要求非常愤怒。他思量着怎样一举消灭这位来犯
的头领。科卡罗斯装作答应他的要求，邀请他赴会商谈。弥诺斯来了，受到科卡
罗斯的盛情款待。经过长途跋涉，弥诺斯准备洗个温水澡来消除旅途的疲劳。等
他坐在浴缸里时，科卡罗斯让人不断加火升温，直到弥诺斯烫死在沸水里。西西
里国王把尸体交给克里特人，说弥诺斯是在洗澡时失足跌入沸水池之中的。克里
特的士兵在阿格里根特城郊隆重地埋葬了弥诺斯，并在他的墓旁建造了一座阿佛
洛狄忒神庙。　　代达罗斯成了科卡罗斯国王的座上客。他在这里培养了许多有
名的艺术家，成为西西里岛土著文化的奠基人。他在那里虽然受到敬重和礼遇，
但由于儿子惨死海中，他内心却一直闷闷不乐，晚年时更加忧郁，苦恼。最后，
他死在西西里，并被埋葬在那里。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事12：坦塔罗斯

    施瓦布

    坦塔罗斯是宙斯的儿子，他统治着吕狄亚的西庇洛斯，以富有而出名。由于
出身高贵，诸神对他十分尊敬。他可以跟宙斯同桌用餐，不用回避神}们的谈话。

    可是他的虚荣心又使他实在不配享有天上的福祉，于是，他开始对诸神作恶。
他泄露他们生活的秘密；从他们的餐桌上偷取蜜酒和仙丹，并把它们分给凡间的
朋友。他把别人在克里特的宙斯神庙里偷走的一条金狗藏在家里。坦塔罗斯窝藏
脏物，拒不交出，将金狗窃为己有。有一天，他邀请诸神到家中作客。为了试探
一下神}们是否通晓一切，他让人把自己的儿子珀罗普斯杀死，然后煎烤烧煮，
做成一桌菜，款待他们。在场的谷物女神得默忒耳因思念被抢走的女儿珀耳塞福
涅，在宴席上心神不定，只有她出于礼貌稍微尝了一块肩胛骨。别的神}早已识
破了他的诡计，纷纷把撕碎的男孩的肢体丢在盆里。命运女神克罗托将他从盆里
取出，让他重新活了过来，可惜肩膀上缺了一块，那是被得默忒耳吃掉的，后来
只好用象牙补做了一块。　　坦塔罗斯因此得罪了神}. 他罪恶滔天，被神}们
打入地狱，在那里备受苦难和折磨。他站在一池深水中间，波浪就在他的下巴下
翻滚。

    可是他却忍受着烈火般的干渴，喝不上一滴凉水，虽然凉水就在嘴边。他只
要弯下腰去，想用嘴喝水，池水立即就从身旁流走，留下他孤身一人空空地站在
一块平地上，就像有个妖魔作法，把池水抽干了似的。同时他又饥饿难忍。在他
身后就是湖岸，岸上长着一排果树，结满了累累果实，树枝被果实压弯了，吊在
他的额前。他只要抬头朝上张望，就能看到树上蜜水欲滴的生梨，鲜红的苹果，
火红的石榴，香喷喷的无花果和绿油油的橄榄。这些水果似乎都在微笑着向他招
呼，可是，等他踮起脚来想要摘取时，空中就会刮起一阵大风，把树枝吹向空中。
除了忍受这些折磨外，最可怕的痛苦则是连续不断的对死神的恐惧，因为他的头
顶上吊着一块大石头，随时都会掉下来，将他压得粉碎。　　坦塔罗斯蔑视神}，
被罚入地狱，永无休止地忍受三重折磨。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事13：珀罗普斯

    施瓦布

    坦塔罗斯亵渎神}，而他的儿子珀罗普斯与父亲相反，对神}十分虔诚。父
亲被罚入地狱后，他被邻近的特洛伊国王伊洛斯赶出了国土，流亡到希腊。这个
少年下巴上还没长出胡子时，心里却早已选中了一位妻子。他的妻子名叫希波达
弥亚，是伊利斯国王俄诺玛诺斯和斯忒洛珀的女儿。这个女子不容易娶到手，因
为一个神谕曾经对父亲预言，女儿结婚时，父亲便会死亡。父亲信以为真，因此
千方百计地阻挠任何人前来向他女儿求婚。他让人四处张贴告示，说凡愿意和他
女儿结婚的人，必须跟他赛车，只有赢他的人才能娶他的女儿。如果国王赢了，
那么他的对手就得被杀死。　　比赛的起点是比萨，终点是哥林多海峡的波塞冬
神坛。国王规定了车辆出发的顺序：他先给宙斯献祭一头公羊，让求婚者驾着四
马战车先走，等到献祭仪式完毕后，他就开始追赶。他的车夫叫密耳提罗斯；国
王站在车上，手执一根长矛。他如果追上竞赛者，就有权用长矛将对手刺翻在地。

    爱慕希波达弥亚年轻美貌的求婚者，虽然听说了这个苛刻的条件，但都不以
为然，以为国王俄诺玛诺斯年老体弱，知道赛不过年轻人，故意让年轻人先走一
程，这样，即使输了，也可为自己找到一个体面的借口。年轻人纷纷赶到伊利斯，
向国王要求娶他的女儿为妻。国王很友好地逐个接待他们，给他们提供一辆漂亮
的马车。四匹马在前面拉动，威武雄壮。他自己则去向宙斯献祭公羊，而且一点
也不匆忙，紧张。等到献祭仪式完毕，他登上一辆轻便车，前面由两匹骏马菲拉
和哈尔彼那拉动，它们奔跑飞快，赛过强劲的北风。他很快就赶上了前面的求婚
者，残忍地用长矛刺穿他的胸膛。就这样十二名求婚者冤死在他的长矛下。

    珀罗普斯为求婚来到这座海滨半岛，这座岛后来就叫做珀罗普纳索斯。不久
他听到有关求婚者在伊利斯惨死的消息。于是他趁着黑夜来到海边，大声地呼唤
强大的守护神波塞冬。　　波塞冬应声驾浪来到他的面前。　　" 伟大的神啊，
" 珀罗普斯祈求道，" 如果你自己也喜欢爱情女神的礼品，那么就请交给我，让
我不会受到俄诺玛诺斯的长矛的伤害，请赐给我神车，让我以最快的速度到达伊
利斯，祈求你保佑我取得胜利。" 　　珀罗普斯的祈求立即生效，水中又响起一
阵哗哗声，波涛中推出了一辆金光闪闪的神车，前面有四匹带翼的飞马拉动，速
度犹如飞箭。珀罗普斯飞身上车，一阵风似的向伊利斯驶去。俄诺玛诺斯看到了
珀罗普斯来到时，大吃一惊，因为他一眼就认出了这是波塞冬的神车。可是他并
不拒绝与小伙子按照原定的条件进行比赛。此外，他对自己骏马的神力充满信心。
珀罗普斯经过长途奔驰十分疲劳。他和骏马休息了几天，等到精力恢复后，便策
马参加比赛。快要接近终点时，依照惯例先给宙斯献祭了公羊的国王追了上来，
挥舞着长矛，正要刺向前面的求婚者的后背。但珀罗普斯的保护神波塞冬急忙赶
来救助。他弄松了国王的车轮，马车摔得粉碎。俄诺玛诺斯飞出马车，即刻坠地
而死。

    这时候，珀罗普斯驾着四匹飞马顺利地到达终点。他回头一看，只见国王的
宫殿里烈火熊熊，原来是雷电击中了宫殿，它烧得只剩下一根柱子露在外面。珀
罗普斯驾着飞车奔到火光冲天的宫殿里，勇敢地救出了她的未婚妻希波达弥亚。

    后来，他统治了伊利斯全国，并夺取了奥林匹亚城，创办了闻名于世的奥林
匹克运动会。他和妻子希波达弥亚生了很多儿子。儿子长大后，分布在珀罗普纳
索斯全境，各自建立了自己的王国。

    施瓦布

    尼俄柏是个骄横的女人，她的丈夫安菲翁是底比斯的国王。缪斯女神送给他
一把漂亮的古琴，琴声美妙，他弹奏的时候，连砖石竟也自动地粘合起来，建起
了底比斯的城墙。尼俄柏的父亲坦塔罗斯，是神}的上宾――当然是在他被打入
地狱以前。她自己统治着一个强大的王国，而且漂亮动人，仪态万千，遐迩闻名。

    不过最使她感到高兴、自豪的是，她有七个儿子和七个女儿。她被视为幸运
的母亲，而且因此自鸣得意，但她的自骄自矜招来了杀身之祸。　　有一天，盲
人占卜家提瑞西阿斯的女儿曼托受神}指使，在街上呼唤底比斯城的妇女全都出
来祭拜勒托和她的双生子女阿波罗和阿耳忒弥斯。她吩咐她们在头上戴一顶桂冠，
并献上祭品。底比斯城的妇女一起涌了出来，尼俄柏也带着她的女侍出来了。她
穿着一件镂金嵌银的长袍，光彩照人，美丽无比。妇女们在露天献祭，尼俄柏站
在她们中间，环顾四周，露出得意而骄傲的目光大声说：" 你们敬奉胡乱编造的
神}，难道疯了吗？可是，这天国的神难道真的来到了你们中间？你们给勒托献
上了祭品，为什么不向我顶礼膜拜？我的父亲可是赫赫有名的坦塔罗斯，他是唯
一可与神}们一起用餐的凡人。我的母亲狄俄涅，是普雷雅德的妹妹。他们都像
天上闪闪发光的星座一样。阿特拉斯也是我的祖先，他是一位力大无穷的人，把
整个天体都扛在自己的肩上。宙斯是我的祖父，他又是众神之祖，所有的夫利基
阿人都听从我的指挥。卡德摩斯的城池，包括所有的城墙都属于我和我的丈夫，
它们是由于我们弹奏古琴才粘合而成的。我的宫殿里珍藏着无数的珍宝，我身材
漂亮，如同一位女神。我生了一群儿女，世界上谁能与我相比：七个如花似玉的
女儿，七个体魄强壮的儿子，不久我将有七个女婿，七个媳妇。请问，难道我没
有足够的理由骄傲吗？你们不敬我，竟敢敬奉勒托，一位提坦神的不知名的女儿。

    她在陆地上几乎找不到一块生养孩子的地方，只有漂浮的提洛斯岛怜悯她，
才给她提供了临时的住处。她一共生了两个孩子，真可怜啊，刚好是我的七分之
一。

    我难道不可以比她高兴七倍吗？谁能不承认我应该更幸福，谁能不承认我应
该永远幸福？命运女神如果要毁灭我的一切，那她还得忙碌一阵，否则不是那么
方便的！所以你们应该撤掉祭品！散开回家去！再不要让我看见你们做这类蠢事！
" 妇女们惊恐地取下头上的桂冠，撤掉祭品，悄悄地回家去，不过心里都在默默
地祈祷，试图平息这个被得罪了的女神的怒火。　　在提洛斯的库恩托斯山顶上，
勒托带着一对双生子女，用一双神眼，把远方底比斯发生的一切都看得清清楚楚。
" 你们看，孩子，" 她说，" 我作为你们的母亲为生下你们而感到自豪。

    除了赫拉以外，我不比任何女神低微，今天却被一个傲慢的人间女子侮辱了
一番。

    如果你们不支持我，我将被她赶出古老的圣坛。我的孩子，连你们也遭到尼
俄柏的恶毒诅咒！" 福玻斯打断了母亲的话，他说：" 别生气，她早晚会遭到惩
罚！

    " 他的妹妹也随声附和。说完，兄妹二人都隐身在云层背后。不一会，他们
就看到了卡德摩斯的城墙和城堡。城门外是一片宽阔的平地，那是供车马比赛的
演武场。尼俄柏的七个儿子正在那里戏嬉。有的骑着烈性野马，有的进行着激烈
的比武竞赛。大儿子伊斯墨诺斯正骑着快马绕圈奔驰，突然，他双手一抬，缰绳
啪的一声滑落，原来一支飞箭射中他的心脏，他顿时从马上跌落下去。他的兄弟
西庇洛斯在一旁听到空中飞箭的声音，吓得连忙伏鞍逃跑，可是仍被一支飞箭射
中，当场毙命，从马上滚落下来。另外两位兄弟，一个以外祖父的名字命名的坦
塔罗斯，另一个是弗提摩斯，两人正抱在一起角力，这时他们听见弓弦响起，结
果被一支飞箭双双穿透射死。第五个儿子阿尔菲诺看到四个哥哥倒地身亡，便惊
恐地赶了过来，把哥哥们冰冷的肢体抱在怀里，想让他们重新活过来，不料胸口
也遭到阿波罗致命的一箭。第六个儿子达玛锡西通是个温柔的、留着长发的青年，
他被射中膝盖。正当他弯下腰去，准备用手拔出箭镞的时候，第二箭从他口中穿
过，他血流如注，倒地而亡。第七个儿子还是个小男孩，名叫伊里俄纽斯，他看
到这一切，急忙跪在地上，伸开双手，哀求着：" 呵，众神哟，请饶恕我吧！"
哀求声尽管打动了可怕的射手，可是射出的利箭再也收不回来了。男孩扑的一声
倒在地上死了，只是痛苦最轻。　　不幸的消息很快传遍了全城。孩子的父亲安
菲翁听到噩耗，悲伤之至，拔剑自刎而死。他的仆人和国民哭声震天，悲泣声立
刻传进了内宫。尼俄柏久久不能理解她的不幸，她不相信天上的神}竟有如此大
的威力，可是不久她就彻底明白了。这时她跟从前的尼俄柏判若两人。她刚才还
把众多的妇女们从伟大的女神的祭坛前驱散，并且趾高气扬地走过全城，不可一
世，现在却一下子惊慌失措地扑在野地里，抱住儿子的尸体亲吻他们。她向空中
伸开双臂，呼天抢地地叫着：" 勒托，你这个残酷的女人，看着我的苦难，你幸
灾乐祸吧，你也该心满意足了吧。七个儿子的死，也会把我送进坟墓的！" 　　
这时候她的七个女儿穿着丧服来到她的身旁。风儿吹散她们的长发，她们悲伤地
站在那里，围着七个惨遭杀害的兄弟。尼俄柏看到女儿，苍白的脸上突然闪出一
种怨恨的光芒，他忘乎所以地看着天空，嘲笑着说：" 不，我即使遭到了不幸，
也胜过你的幸福；我即使遭到了惨重的灾祸，我还是比你更富有，还是一位强者！
" 话还没有说完，空中就传来一阵弓弦的声音，每个人都十分恐惧，只有尼俄柏
无动于衷。巨大的不幸已经使她麻木了。突然，一个女儿紧紧地捂着胸口，挣扎
着拔出箭镞，无力地瘫倒在一个兄弟的尸体旁。另一个女儿急忙奔向不幸的母亲
那儿，想去安慰她，可是一支无情的箭射来，她也一声不响地倒了下去。第三个
在逃跑中被射倒在地，其余的几个也相继倒在死去的姐妹身边。只剩下最小的一
个女儿，她惊恐地躲在母亲的怀里，钻在母亲的衣服下面。　　" 给我留下最后
一个吧，" 尼俄柏悲痛地朝苍天呼喊着，" 她是兄弟姐妹中最小的一个！" 可是，
即使她苦苦哀求，这最小的孩子也终于从她的怀里瘫倒在地。尼俄柏孤零零地坐
在她丈夫、七个儿子和七个女儿的尸体中间。她伤心得突然变得僵硬了：头发在
风中一动也不动，脸上失去了血色，眼珠木然地瞪视着。生命离开了她的躯体，
血液在血管里冻结，脉搏停止了跳动。尼俄柏变成了一块冰冷的石头，全身完全
硬化，只是僵化的眼睛里不断地淌着眼泪。一阵旋风将她吹到空中，又吹过了大
海，一直把她送到尼俄柏的故乡，搁在吕狄亚的一座荒山上，下面是西庇洛斯悬
崖。尼俄柏成了一座石像，静静地站在山峰上，直到现在还淌着悲伤的眼泪。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事15：阿克特翁

    施瓦布

    阿克特翁是阿里斯塔俄斯和卡德摩斯的女儿奥托纳沃的儿子，其父喜爱打猎。

    阿克特翁年轻时跟半人半马的肯陶洛斯人喀戎学习打猎的诀窍。有一天，他
跟一群快乐的伙伴在基太隆山区的森林里围猎。中午，太阳火辣辣地照着，酷热
炙人，他们急于想寻找一块树荫纳凉。这时，阿克特翁对伙伴们说：" 今天我们
打了不少野味，围猎就此结束！明天再打吧。" 围猎的人四下散开，他带着几条
猎犬走进森林深处，想找一块荫凉处睡一觉。　　附近有座加耳菲亚山谷，长满
了松树和柏树，是呈献给阿耳忒弥斯的一块圣地。山谷深处的一角有一个树木遮
掩着的山洞。清泉汇成一池湖水，年轻的女神狩猎回来，常常在水里洗澡消除疲
劳。这时，她正由一群女仆簇拥着走进山洞。她把猎枪、弓箭、箭袋交给后面的
奴仆。

    一位女仆给她脱下衣服，还有两位女仆解下她脚上的鞋带。聪慧而美丽的库
洛卡勒将阿耳忒弥斯松散的头发扎成一把，然后她们从清泉里舀来凉水，冲洗她
的身体。　　女神正在快乐地洗澡，卡德摩斯的外孙阿克特翁来到树丛深处。他
无意之中踏进了阿耳忒弥斯的圣林，找到一块凉爽的休息地，非常高兴。女仆们
突然看到一位不速之客突然闯了进来，不禁惊叫起来，一起过去围住女主人，不
让他看到她的胴体。可是女神高高地站在那里，羞得面色绯红，一双眼睛直愣愣
地盯着闯进来的男子。他还呆呆地站在那里，一动不动。他非常吃惊，完全被眼
前的美人迷住了。多么不幸的男人啊！如果他迅速逃走，尽快退出这块是非之地，
那该多好啊！这时，女神突然俯下身子，退到一旁，一面用手在湖水里舀起一g
水，喷在对面小伙子的头上和脸上，一面威胁着说：" 如果你有本事的话，去告
诉大家吧，你看到了什么！" 　　女神的话还没有说完，小伙子感到一阵害怕。
他扭头就跑，跑得飞快，连他自己都感到吃惊。不幸的男人没有发觉他的头上长
出了一对犄角，脖子变得细长，耳朵变得又长又尖。他的双臂变成了大腿，双手
变成了蹄子，身上长出了斑斑点点的毛皮。他已经不是人了，愤怒的女神将他变
成了一头鹿。他到了湖边，从水里看到了自己的容貌。" 天哪，我这不幸的可怜
人！

    " 他正想呼喊，可是嘴巴僵硬得像石头一样，发不出声来。他痛哭流涕，眼
泪顺着脸颊淌下来，只有思想还没有丧失。　　他该怎么办呢？是回到外祖父的
宫殿里去，还是藏在密林里？正当他又羞又怕的时候，他的一群猎狗围拢过来，
一齐冲向雄鹿，追得他漫山遍野地逃窜。他一会儿逃上悬崖，一会儿逃进峡谷，
惊恐万状地在他从前围追猎物的林场上逃命，自己成了围猎的对象。最后，一条
凶恶的猎犬吼叫着扑上来，一口咬在他的背上。别的猎狗一呼而上，锋利的牙齿
将他咬得遍体鳞伤。正在这时，他的一群狩猎的朋友也闻声而至，放出恶狗，拼
命撕咬着这头壮鹿。猎友们高声欢呼着，寻找他们的主人。" 阿克特翁！" 深山
密林里响起呼唤声，" 你在哪里？瞧，我们猎到了一头壮鹿！" 　　可怜的鹿被
穿在他的朋友的猎枪上，渐渐地断了气。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事16：普洛克涅和菲罗墨拉

    施瓦布

    潘狄翁是从泥土中生出的厄里克托尼俄斯和帕茜特阿女神所生的儿子，他后
来成了雅典的国王。潘狄翁娶了漂亮的女水神策雨茜泼，她生下双生子厄瑞克透
斯和波特斯，还生下两个女儿：普洛克涅和菲罗墨拉。　　有一次，底比斯的国
王拉布达科斯同潘狄翁发生了争斗，率领军队侵入阿提喀。雅典人经过激烈的抵
抗，最后都退缩在城内。潘狄翁眼看兵临城下，匆忙向英勇善战的色雷斯国王忒
瑞俄斯救援。忒瑞俄斯是战神阿瑞斯的儿子。他迅速率领军队前来解围，最后把
底比斯人赶出了阿提喀。潘狄翁为了感谢他，把女儿普洛克涅远嫁给这位声誉赫
赫的英雄。不久，普洛克涅生下儿子伊迪斯。　　不知不觉过去了五年，普洛克
涅远离家园，感到异常孤寂，心中顿生对妹妹菲罗墨拉的思念之情。于是，她对
丈夫说：" 如果你爱我的话，就请让我回雅典去，把我妹妹接来，或者你去那里，
将她接来。你对父亲说，她在这里逗留一段时间就会回去的。不然父亲会担心，
不愿放女儿离开很长时间。" 　　忒瑞俄斯马上就同意了，带着仆人，乘船驶往
雅典，不久到了雅典的海港城市拜里厄司，受到岳父的热情接待。还在进城的途
中，忒瑞俄斯就转告了妻子的愿望，并向国王保证，菲罗墨拉不会待多长时间。

    到了宫殿后，菲罗墨拉亲自前来问候姐夫忒瑞俄斯，不断地向他询问姐姐的
情况。

    忒瑞俄斯见她光彩照人，美艳非凡，爱慕之情像烈火一样炽热，暗暗打定主
意要把菲罗墨拉骗到手。他暂时按捺住心中骚动的情绪，一本正经地说起普洛克
涅对妹妹的渴念之情。他心中在酝酿着邪恶的计划，但表面上却是一副正人君子
的样子，潘狄翁对他赞不绝口。菲罗墨拉也被他迷住了。她用双手勾住父亲的脖
子，恳求他同意她到远方看望姐姐。国王恋恋不舍地答应了女儿的请求，女儿说
不出的高兴，连忙感谢父亲。他们三人进了宫殿，国王用美酒佳肴盛情款待宾客，
直到傍晚时分才散席。　　第二天清晨，年迈的潘狄翁含着热泪同女儿分别，他
紧紧地握住女婿的手说：" 我可爱的儿子，因为你们一致要求，我就把心爱的小
女儿托付给你了。凭着我们的亲戚关系，对着天上的诸位神}，我恳请你，千万
要像慈祥的父亲一样爱护妹妹，而且不久以后就将妹妹送回来。" 他一边说，一
边吻着自己的孩子，然后跟他们吻别，并请他们转告对女儿普洛克涅和外孙的问
候。

    船开了，渐渐驶入大海。　　不久他们就到了色雷斯。船稳稳地靠港了，他
们一起上了岸。水手们由于旅途疲劳，都赶回家去。忒瑞俄斯却悄悄地把菲罗墨
拉带进密林深处，把她锁在一间牧人小屋里。菲罗墨拉又惊又怕，流着泪打听姐
姐的情况。忒瑞俄斯谎称普洛克涅已经死了，为了不让潘狄翁哀伤，他故意编造
了邀请菲罗墨拉的故事。实际上他是为了娶菲罗墨拉为妻，才赶往雅典的。他一
边说，一边假惺惺地哭了起来，装作一副伤心的样子。无论菲罗墨拉如何苦苦哀
求，都无济于事，她只得流着痛苦的眼泪不情愿地成了忒瑞俄斯的妻子。可是，
没过多久她就恢复了理智，心里产生了一种不祥的预感和可怕的怀疑。她默默地
思忖，忒瑞俄斯为什么将我锁在远离宫殿的密林深处，像对待犯人一样？为什么
他不让我像一个真正的王后一样住在他的宫殿里呢？　　有一次，她无意中听到
仆人们的议论。知道普洛克涅还活着，她顿时明白她跟忒瑞俄斯的婚姻是一场罪
恶，她成了姐姐的情敌。一股怒火油然而生，她仇视姐夫对姐姐的背叛，飞快地
冲进他的房间，大声对他说，她已经知道了真相。她狠狠地诅咒他，发誓要把他
卑鄙的行径和罪恶的伎俩公布于众，让人人都知道他是一个无耻的人。她的话激
怒了忒瑞俄斯，同时，他也感到十分害怕。为了保险起见，他决定不让任何人知
道他的丑行，可是他又不敢杀害一个无辜的女子，他想出了一个恶毒的办法。他
把菲罗墨拉的双手反绑起来，然后抽出利剑，像要杀害她似的。她心甘情愿地等
着一死了之。可是，正当她痛苦地呼喊父亲名字的时候，忒瑞俄斯却一剑割掉了
她的舌头。现在他不再担心有人暴露他的秘密了。他像什么也没有发生似地离开
了她，严厉地命令仆人对她严加看管，不准有任何懈怠。　　忒瑞俄斯回到宫殿，
普洛克涅问他，怎么没有同妹妹一起回来。这时他假惺惺地含着眼泪说，菲罗墨
拉已经死了，并已埋葬了。普洛克涅听了悲痛欲绝，她脱下金银彩服，换上一件
黑纱长服，又为妹妹建了一座空墓，摆上供品奠祭妹妹的亡灵。　　一年过去了。
被残暴弄哑的菲罗墨拉顽强地活了下来，她在严密的看管下，失去了一切自由，
她口不能言，无法向世人揭露忒瑞俄斯的卑鄙和可耻的行径。可是，不幸使她变
得更加聪明，她坐在织机旁，在雪白的麻纱布上织出了紫铜色的字样，她要把她
的悲惨遭遇让姐姐知晓。她菇苦含辛，费力织成了麻布，然后做着手势哀求仆人
将麻布送给王后普洛克涅。仆人不知道其中的奥妙便答应了。普洛克涅摊开麻布，
发现了上面的字样，她知道了丈夫所干的骇人听闻的暴行。她欲哭无泪，甚至发
不出一声叹息，因为她的痛苦太深了，她脑子里只有一个念头：报仇！向暴徒报
仇！　　夜幕降临，色雷斯的妇女们热情地庆祝着巴克科斯酒神节。王后也戴上
葡萄花环，手执酒神杖，匆忙跟着一群妇女来到丛林。她内心充满悲愤和痛苦，
大声呼号着，发泄满腔怒火。她躲过看守，悄悄地走近孤零零的牧人小屋，里面
关着她的妹妹菲罗墨拉。她抑制不住激动的心情，扑向妹妹，急忙拉着她逃了出
来，来到忒瑞俄斯的宫殿。她把妹妹藏在一间密室里，告诉她：" 眼泪救不了我
们！为了报仇雪恨，我作好了一切准备。" 这时，她的儿子伊迪斯走进来问候母
亲。普洛克涅却木然地看着他，小声地自言自语：" 他长得多像父亲！" 儿子在
她身旁跳起来，用小手臂勾住母亲的脖子，在她脸上吻了个遍。母亲的心只是稍
微感动了一阵，然后，她一把推开孩子，拿出一把尖刀，怀着疯狂的复仇愿望，
用刀刺进亲生儿子的心口。　　国王忒瑞俄斯坐在祖先的祭坛前，他的妻子送上
可口的菜肴，他吃完后，问道：" 我的儿子伊迪斯在哪里？""远在天边，近在眼
前，他离你不能再近了！" 普洛克涅冷笑着说。　　忒瑞俄斯不解地朝四周张望，
这时菲罗墨拉走了进来，她把一颗血淋淋的孩子脑袋仍在他的脚下。他顿时明白
了一切，马上掀翻了餐桌，拔出剑来扑向拼命逃跑的两姐妹。她们跑得像飞似的。

    咦，她们真的长出了翅膀，一个飞进了树林，另一个飞到屋顶上。普洛克涅
变成了一只燕子，菲罗墨拉变成了一只夜莺，胸前还沾着几滴血迹，这是杀人留
下来的印痕。当然，卑鄙的忒瑞俄斯也变了，变成了戴胜鸟，高耸着羽毛，撅着
尖尖的嘴，永远地追赶着夜莺和燕子，成为它们的天敌。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事17：墨勒阿革洛斯和野猪

    施瓦布

    卡吕冬的国王俄纽斯虔诚地以丰收季节的新鲜果物献祭神}：谷物献给墨忒
耳，葡萄献给巴克科斯，油料献给雅典娜，每位神}都有相应的祭品。可是他却
忘掉了给狩猎女神阿耳忒弥斯献祭。她的祭坛前没有供品，也没有缭绕的烟火。

    女神十分生气，她决定对冷漠她的人报复。女神朝卡吕冬的原野上放出一头
巨大的野猪。它血红的眼睛里喷射出熊熊的火焰，它宽阔的背上竖着坚硬的鬃毛，
粗大锐利的獠牙如同象牙一般。这野猪在庄稼地肆意践踏，连枝带叶地把葡萄和
橄榄吞吃掉。牧人和牧羊狗看到它都赶紧躲开，根本无法保护他们的羊群。　　
野猪成了可怕的妖怪。　　国王的儿子墨勒阿革洛斯挺身而出，召集一批猎人和
猎犬来捕杀这头凶恶的野猪。他邀请全希腊最勇敢的人前来围猎。其中有亚加狄
亚的女英雄阿塔兰忒，她是伊阿李斯的女儿，幼年时被遗弃在树林里，由一头母
熊哺乳。后来，她被猎人发现带回，将她抚养成人。从此她就以树林为家，靠狩
猎为生，出落成一位漂亮的女子，但对男人却十分厌恶。她拒绝一切靠近她的男
人。

    有两个半人半马的妖怪企图在荒野之中追求她，也被她用弓箭射杀。因为她
喜欢狩猎，所以现在只好不避男女之嫌了。她把头发挽成发髻，肩上挂着象牙色
的箭袋，右手执弓，脸色红润，在男人眼里像美女，在女郎眼里像美男子。墨勒
阿革洛斯看到她人品出众，心里想：" 能够娶她为妻的男人该是多么幸福啊！"
但他没有时间再想下去，因为危险的狩猎已迫在眉睫，再也不能拖延了。　　猎
人们来到一座沿山坡逶迤而上的古老的森林里，有的布罗网设陷阱，有的放开猎
犬，有的寻觅野猪的踪迹。现在，他们来到一座峻峭的山谷，山谷里长满了浓密
的芦苇和水杨，野猪就躲在这里。它被猎犬的狂吠声惊起，窜了出来，冲断了数
不清的树木。猎人们齐声呼喊，紧紧抓住长矛，但野猪看到前面人多，便避开他
们，朝斜里冲刺过去，猎人们赶紧追过去，朝它投掷矛枪和飞镖，可是这一切只
能擦破它的硬皮，使它激怒，野性大发。它瞪着冒火的眼睛重新转过头来，扑向
猎人，顿时冲倒了三个猎人，他们当场被踩死。阿塔兰忒及时赶到，弯弓搭箭，
朝着野猪射去一箭，射中它的耳根。猪鬃上第一次染上了血迹。墨勒阿革洛斯看
到野猪受了伤，立即把这消息告诉了猎人们。男人们见一个女人竟抢在他们前面
立了功，感到很羞愧，他们立刻跳起身子，把长矛和飞镖朝野猪掷去。可是这一
阵雨点似的乱发竟没有一支击中野猪。现在一位亚加狄亚人双手举着一柄利斧，
愤怒地扑上去，可是还没砍到野猪，就被野猪的獠牙拱翻在地，送了性命。这时，
伊阿宋也投去一矛，没有击中野猪，却打中了一条猎狗。墨勒阿革洛斯连投两矛，
第一矛落在地上，第二矛正好击中猪背。野猪兽性大发，在原地暴躁地打转，口
中喷吐着鲜血和白沫。墨勒阿革洛斯赶上去，举起长矛，刺进野猪的脖子。猎人
们纷纷举矛刺杀，野猪身上被戳成蜂窝似的，它挣扎了一下，倒在血泊之中。墨
勒阿革洛斯一只脚踩着它的头，用剑连毛带肉地剥下了猪皮。他把猪皮连同猪头
一起送给勇敢的阿塔兰忒，对她说：" 收下战利品吧！按理说它应该归我，可是
更大的一份荣誉应该归于你！" 　　猎人们却愤愤不平，认为她不该享受这份荣
誉。

    墨勒阿革洛斯的几个舅舅更是不服，他们站到阿塔兰忒的面前，挥舞着拳头，
说：" 放下手中的战利品，你别想得到这份猎物，它是属于我们的！" 说着他们
一把抢过猎物扬长而去。墨勒阿革洛斯受不了这样的侮辱，咆哮道：" 你们这些
强盗！" 他挺起长矛就朝他的一个舅舅刺了过去，第二个舅舅还没明白是怎么回
事时，墨勒阿革洛斯的长矛也刺进了他的胸膛。　　墨勒阿革洛斯的母亲阿尔泰
亚听说儿子围猎得胜非常高兴。她立即前往神庙给神}献祭表示感谢。途中，她
看到抬来的却是两个兄弟的尸体。阿尔泰亚匆忙赶回宫殿，穿上丧服。当她听说
凶手是自己的儿子墨勒阿革洛斯时，她才强忍着泪水，将悲哀变成了仇恨，思量
着要替兄弟们报仇，她想起墨勒阿革洛斯生下没几天，命运三女神曾来到她的床
前。

    " 你的儿子将成为一个勇敢的英雄，" 第一位女神预言说。" 你的儿子寿命
像…

    …" 第二位女神还没有说完，第三位女神就接过了话头：" 像炉子上的木柴
一样，直到被火烧完。" 三位命运女神刚刚离开，阿尔泰亚连忙把木柴从火中取
出来，用水浇灭，然后藏在密室里。现在她在复仇的愤怒中，又想起这木柴，于
是立即走进密室，她吩咐仆人架起木柴生好炉子，火焰熊熊燃起。阿尔泰亚的内
心里母子之爱和手足之情在激烈地冲突着。她四次伸手，要将木柴扔进火中，却
又四次把手缩了回来。终于，兄弟的情谊战胜了母爱。她呼喊了一声：" 啊，复
仇女神哟，请你们望着火中献给你们的祭品吧！还有你们，我的兄弟们，你们的
亡灵哟，也看看我在为你们在干什么事吧！一颗母亲的心已经破碎。不久，我也
跟你们而去。" 说着，她闭上眼睛，用一只颤抖的手将木柴投进熊熊的烈火中。
　　墨勒阿革洛斯这时正在回城的途上。突然他感到内心有如火烧般的灼痛。刚
到宫殿，他痛得难以忍受，一头倒在床上。他竭力地挣扎着，心里十分羡慕那些
凯旋的猎人们。他们一个个兴高采烈，庆祝狩猎的胜利。墨勒阿革洛斯在痛苦中
呼叫他的兄弟，他的妹妹，他的年迈的父亲和母亲，而他的母亲还呆呆地站在火
堆旁，一双迟钝的眼睛看着烈火在焚烧木片。儿子的痛苦随着木片的燃烧而剧烈。
最后，当木柴烧成灰烬时，他的痛苦消失了，他的生命也结束了。父亲、姐妹和
全卡吕冬的人都为失掉了这位英雄而悲哀。只有母亲不在那里，她已经死在火堆
旁了。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事18：西绪福斯和柏勒洛丰

    施瓦布

    埃俄罗斯的儿子西绪福斯是所有的人类中最奸诈的人。他在两个国家之间的
狭窄地带建立并统治着美丽的城邦科任托斯。由于他背叛了宙斯，死后被打入地
狱受惩罚。每天清晨，他都必须将一块沉重的巨石从平地搬到山顶上去。每当他
自以为已经搬到山顶时，石头就突然顺着山坡滚下去。这作恶的西绪福斯必须重
新回头搬动石头，艰难地挪步爬上山去。　　西绪福斯的孙子柏勒洛丰，即科任
托斯国王格劳卜斯的儿子。他因为过失杀人，被迫逃亡，来到提任斯，在这里受
到国王普洛托斯的热情接待，并被赦免了罪行。柏勒洛丰仪表堂堂，身材魁梧。

    国王普洛托斯的妻子安忒亚对他一见倾心，企图引诱她。可是柏勒洛丰心地
善良，为人高尚，他对她的挑逗十分冷淡。她见企图不能得逞，老羞成怒，于是
在丈夫面前说：" 我的丈夫，如果你不想受羞辱，败坏自己的名誉，就该把柏勒
洛丰杀死，因为他是个不老实的人，他企图引诱我，让我背叛你的爱情。" 　　
国王轻信了她的话，心里升起一股无名怒火。但因为他对年轻的柏勒洛丰十分赏
识，所以又不忍心杀害他，想用别的办法报复他。他派柏勒洛丰到他的岳父，即
吕喀亚国王伊俄巴忒斯那里，并让他带去一封密封的家信。其实信上要国王把来
者处死。

    柏勒洛丰被蒙在鼓里，毫不怀疑地出发了。他急匆匆往前走，走向死亡，这
时，天上的诸神也一路保护他。他渡过大海，穿过美丽的河流克珊托斯，来到吕
喀亚，见到了国王伊俄巴忒斯。这是一位热情有礼的贤君。他设宴招待外乡的贵
客，并不问他是谁，更没有问他从哪里来。他的高贵的举止和俊秀的仪表足已表
明他不是一个寻常的客人。国王给客人享受各种荣誉，每天都像过节似地宴请他，
并为他宰牛敬献神}. 直到第十天，他才问起客人的身世和来意，柏勒洛丰告诉
他，自己从普洛托斯国王那里来，并呈上一封家书。伊俄巴忒斯国王看完信，吓
得倒抽一口冷气，十分惶恐，因为他很喜欢面前这位风度翩翩的客人。可是他想，
如果没有重大原因，他的女婿一定不会处死他的。国王若有所思地点了点头，不
过他见面前这位在此作客十天的年轻人举止温文尔雅，谈吐不俗，又不忍心派人
杀害他。最后，他为了摆脱为难的境地，决定派他去作必死无疑的冒险。他先命
令柏勒洛丰消灭危害吕喀亚的怪物喀迈拉。这怪物是巨人堤丰与巨蛇厄喀德那所
生的儿子，它上半身像狮子，下半身像恶龙，中间像山羊，口中喷着火苗，烈焰
腾腾，委实可怕。天上诸神都可怜这个无辜的年轻人。他们眼见柏勒洛丰将要遭
到大祸，便急忙派波塞冬和墨杜萨所生的一匹双翼飞马珀伽索斯去援助他。可是
飞马怎样才能援助他呢？它从来没有让人骑过，十分狂野，撒泼，无法抓住和驯
服。

    柏勒洛丰努力了一阵，累得精疲力竭，最后竟在皮勒内河边睡着了。他做了
一个梦，梦见他的保护神雅典娜。她交给他一副壮丽的带有金色饰物的辔头，对
他说：" 你怎么睡着了？带上它吧，给波塞冬献祭一头公牛，以后就可以使用这
副辔头！" 柏勒洛丰突然从梦中醒来。他跳起身，看到手上果然有一副金光闪闪
的辔头。　　柏勒洛丰找到解梦算命的波吕德斯，把梦中的情景告诉他，请他圆
梦。

    波吕德斯劝他听从女神的建议，杀一头公牛祭祀波塞冬，并给保护他的女神
雅典娜造一座祭坛。等到这一切都做完以后，柏勒洛丰果然毫不费力地把双翼飞
马驯服了，他把辔头套在马头上，然后穿上盔甲，骑马腾空而行，弯弓搭箭，射
死了怪物喀迈拉。　　接着，伊俄巴忒斯又派柏勒洛丰去攻打索吕默人。索吕默
人蛮勇好战，居住在吕喀亚边地。出乎国王的意料，柏勒洛丰又在艰苦的战斗中
取得了胜利。后来，国王又派他去跟亚马孙人作战，他也安然无恙地得胜回来。
伊俄巴忒斯见难不倒柏勒洛丰，于是心生一计，在柏勒洛丰凯旋途中设置埋伏狙
击柏勒洛丰。可是袭击柏勒洛丰的士兵全被他消灭，无一生还。直到这时，伊俄
巴忒斯才明白这个年轻人根本不是罪人，而是神的宠儿。他再也不敢杀害他了，
反而把他接回宫中，和他分享王位，还把美丽的女儿菲罗诺厄嫁给他为妻。吕喀
亚人献给他肥沃的土地和丰盛的作物。他的妻子生下两个男孩和一个女儿，生活
过得十分美满。　　时过境迁，柏勒洛丰的幸福也到了尽头。他的大儿子伊桑特
洛斯在跟索吕默人的战争中不幸阵亡。女儿拉俄达弥亚跟宙斯生了英雄的儿子萨
耳珀冬，后来却被狩猎女神阿耳忒弥斯一箭射死。只有小儿子希波洛库斯活到高
龄。

    他在特洛伊人反对希腊人的战争中派儿子格劳库斯参战。格劳库斯与他的表
兄弟萨耳珀冬率领一队吕喀亚士兵援助特洛伊人。　　柏勒洛丰因为拥有双翼飞
马而变得骄矜起来。他骑着马想到奥林匹斯圣山，参加神}集会，尽管他是个凡
人。

    可是神马却不愿听从他的指挥，在天空直立起来，把他摔落坠地。柏勒洛丰
虽然没有摔死，但遭到神的抛弃。他到处飘流，羞于见人，一直躲躲藏藏，隐居
在没有人烟的地方，在忧虑中度过余生。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-1：伊阿宋和珀利阿斯

    施瓦布

    注：第19章总标题为《阿耳戈英雄们的故事》　　伊阿宋是埃宋的儿子，克
瑞透斯的孙子。克瑞透斯在帖撒利的海湾建立城池和爱俄尔卡斯王国，并把王国
传给儿子埃宋。后来，埃宋的弟弟珀利阿斯篡夺了王位。埃宋死后，他的儿子伊
阿宋逃到半人半马的肯陶洛斯族人喀戎那儿。喀戎训练伊阿宋做一个英雄。在珀
利阿斯年迈时，他为一种神谕而感到不安。神谕警告他提防只穿一只鞋的人。他
反复思忖，也猜不透这话的含义。伊阿宋２０岁时，动身返回故乡，要向珀利阿
斯讨回王位继承权。他带了两根长矛，一根用来投掷，一根用来刺杀。他身上裹
着野豹皮，长发披散在肩上。在途中，他经过一条大河，河旁一位老妇，求他帮
助她渡过河去。实际上，她是神}之母赫拉，是国王珀利阿斯的仇人。因为她作
了伪装，伊阿宋竟没有认出她来。他背着老妇人过河。在河中，他一只鞋子陷在
泥淖里拔不出来。他就一只脚穿着鞋子，一只脚赤着，继续赶路，来到爱俄尔卡
斯的市场上，一群人正在忙忙碌碌，原来是他叔父珀利阿斯正在那里虔诚地祭献
海神波塞冬。人们看到伊阿宋英俊魁梧，气宇轩昂，都很惊异，以为是阿波罗或
阿瑞斯来到了人间。正在摆设祭品的国王看到走过来的伊阿宋，也不禁吃了一惊，
因为这个外乡人只穿了一只鞋子。当神圣的祭祀仪式完毕后，他立即朝这个外乡
人走去，问他是谁，家在哪里。珀利阿斯问话时尽管装作若无其事的样子，但内
心却充满疑虑和恐惧。　　伊阿宋大胆地回答说，他是埃宋的儿子，在喀戎的山
洞里长大。现在他回来了，想看看父亲的旧居。狡黠的珀利阿斯客气地听着，亲
切地接待了他，不让丝毫的惊恐与不安流露出来。他派人带伊阿宋到宫殿内到处
走走看看。伊阿宋以渴慕的目光打量着父亲的旧居，内心感到很满足。接连五天，
他同堂兄弟和亲属们欢宴庆祝他们的重逢。第六天，他们离开了为宾客特意搭建
的帐篷，来到国王珀利阿斯的面前。伊阿宋谦和地对叔父说：" 国王哟，你知道，
我是合法君王的儿子，你所占据的一切都是属于我的。但我仍愿意把羊群、牛群
和土地都留给你，尽管这些都是你从我父王那儿夺去的。我其他什么也不要，只
要讨回我父王的权杖和王位。" 　　珀利阿斯很快地镇定下来，亲切地说：" 我
愿意满足你的要求。但你也必须答应我的一个请求，替我做一件事。我因为年迈
体衰，已经无力做这件事了。长久以来，我夜里做梦老是梦到佛里克索斯的阴魂。

    他要求我让他的灵魂平静，满足他的一个愿望，到科尔喀斯的国王埃厄忒斯
那儿去，取回他的遗骸和金羊毛。照理该我去，但我现在只得把这光荣的使命交
给你了，你可以从中获得无尚的荣誉。当你带回这宝贵的战利品时，你就能得到
权杖和王位。"

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-2：阿耳戈英雄们乘船出发

    施瓦布

    金羊毛的来历是这样的：佛里克索斯是玻俄提亚国王阿塔玛斯的儿子，他受
尽了父亲的宠妾伊诺的虐待。他的生母涅斐勒为了搭救儿子，在他的姐姐赫勒的
帮助下，把儿子从宫中悄悄地抱了出来。涅斐勒是一位云神，她让儿子和女儿骑
在有双翼的公羊背上。这公羊的毛是纯金的。那是她从众神的使者、亡灵接引神
赫耳墨斯那儿得到的礼物。姐弟俩骑着这头神奇的羊凌空飞翔，飞过了陆地和海
洋。在途中，姐姐赫勒一阵头晕，从羊背上坠落下去，掉在海里淹死了。那海从
此就称为赫勒海，又称赫勒斯蓬托。佛里克索斯则平安地到达黑海沿岸的科尔喀
斯，受到国王埃厄忒斯的热情接待，并把女儿卡尔契俄柏许配给他。佛里克索斯
宰杀金羊祭献宙斯，感谢他保佑他逃脱。他把金羊毛作为礼物献给国王埃厄忒斯。

    国王又将它转献给战神阿瑞斯，他吩咐人把它钉在纪念阿瑞斯的圣林里，并
派一条火龙看守着，因为神谕告诉他，他的生命跟金羊毛紧紧地联系在一起，金
羊毛存则他存，金羊毛亡则他亡。　　金羊毛被看作稀世珍宝，很久以来，希腊
人对它传说纷纷。许多英雄和君王都想得到它。所以，珀利阿斯国王理所当然地
认为，应该鼓励伊阿宋去取回这件宝物。伊阿宋真的同意了，他没有看出叔父的
真正用意是要他冒险身亡，却欣然答应完成这次冒险事业。　　希腊著名的英雄
们都被邀请参加这一英勇的盛举。聪明绝顶的希腊建筑师阿耳戈在佩利翁山脚下，
在雅典娜的指导下，用在海水里不会腐烂的坚木造了一条华丽的大船，船上共有
五十支船桨。大船以造船者的名字命名为" 阿耳戈" ，阿耳戈是阿利斯多的儿子。
这艘船是希腊人在海上航行的最大的一艘船。帆具用多多那神殿前的一棵会说话
的栎树上的木料制成，这木板可用来占卜，这是女神雅典娜的赠物。华丽的大船
两侧装饰着富丽的花纹板，但船体很轻，所以英雄们可以把它扛在肩上运走。

    当大船造好并装备停当后，阿耳戈船上的水手抽签决定自己在船上的位置。
伊阿宋担任船上的指挥，提费斯掌舵，眼力敏锐的林扣斯为领港员，著名的英雄
赫拉克勒斯掌管前舱，阿喀琉斯的父亲珀琉斯和埃阿斯的父亲忒拉蒙负责后舱。
其余的水手还有宙斯的儿子卡斯托耳和波吕丢刻斯，皮罗斯国王涅斯托耳的父亲
涅琉斯，忠贞的妻子阿尔刻提斯的丈夫阿德墨托斯，杀死卡吕冬野猪的墨勒阿革
洛斯，天才的歌手俄耳甫斯，帕特洛克罗斯的父亲墨诺提俄斯，后来当了雅典国
王的忒修斯和他的朋友庇里托俄斯，赫拉克勒斯的年轻朋友许拉斯，海神波塞冬
的儿子奥宇弗莫斯和小埃阿斯的父亲俄琉斯。伊阿宋把他的船祭献给海神波塞冬。
起航前，所有的英雄都给波塞冬和其余海神献祭供品，并虔诚地祈祷。　　当所
有的英雄在船中就位后，伊阿宋一声令下，他们就拔锚启航，五十支船桨一起划
动，大船乘风破浪地前进，不久爱俄尔卡斯港就远远地被抛在后面。英雄们意气
风发，驶过了海岛和山峦。第二天，海上起了一阵大风，汹涌的波浪把他们一直
送到雷姆诺斯岛的港口。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-3：阿耳戈英雄们在雷姆诺斯岛

    施瓦布

    在雷姆诺斯岛上，一年前发生了一件怪事，妇女们几乎都杀死了岛上的男人，
即他们的丈夫，因为她们的丈夫从色雷斯带回了许多外乡女子，爱神阿弗洛狄忒
激起了她们的妒火。妇女中只有许珀茜柏勒原谅了她的父亲托阿斯国王，将他藏
在木箱里，抛在大海里，任其漂流。　　从此以后，妇女们总是担心色雷斯人会
来袭击雷姆诺斯，她们常常怀着戒心站在岸边眺望海上，提防有船只突然驶来。

    现在，当她们看到阿耳戈船快速靠近海岸，不由得惊恐起来。她们全副武装，
纷纷冲出城门，像亚马孙女人国的士兵一样，在海岸上严阵以待。阿耳戈的英雄
们看到海岸上麇集着一群武装的妇人，却没有一个男人，感到非常惊异。他们派
出一位使者，手持和平节杖，乘一只小船靠岸，来到这支奇怪的队伍前。她们簇
拥着他，带他去见女王许珀茜柏勒。使者彬彬有礼地传达了阿耳戈英雄们的请求，
让他们进港休息。女王立刻把她的部下召集在城中的市场上，自己端坐在从前父
亲坐过的大理石王座上，向众人报告阿耳戈英雄们的和平要求。她站起身来，说
：" 亲爱的姐妹们，我们已经犯下极大罪孽，愚蠢地消灭了全部男人。现在，他
们央求我们，我们不能摒弃朋友。但是，我们也要提防，别让他们知道我们的蠢
事。因此，我建议把食物、美酒和其他的必需品送上船去，以这种友好的姿态来
保障我们的安全，让这批异乡人远远地待在城外。" 　　女王说完又坐了下去。

    这时一个老得连说话都十分费劲的妇人说：" 给外乡人送礼，这做得很对，
但也应该想到，如果色雷斯人冲过来，那时该怎么办？要是有一位仁慈的神保佑，
那我们就可以安心地睡觉，不必担心有危险。当然，像我这样的老太婆，根本用
不着害怕，反正危险还没有来临，一切还没有完蛋的时候，我们就会死了。你们
年轻人可不同，你们以后怎么生活呢？难道耕牛会自己套上牛轭，自己在田里耕
地吗？它们会替你们去收割庄稼吗？你们是不愿意干这种苦活的。我劝你们别错
过送上门的机会，赶快把一切财产交给异乡人，让他们来治理你们的城市吧！"
老人的建议赢得了妇女们的赞同。女王派出一名年轻的女子随使者一起回到船上，
向阿耳戈的英雄们表达了她们的愿望。英雄们听了都很高兴，他们毫不怀疑，还
以为许珀茜柏勒是在父亲死后和平地继承王位的。伊阿宋披上雅典娜赠送的紫色
斗篷，动身进城了。当他穿过城门的时候，女人们涌出门来欢迎他，对这位客人
感到很满意。伊阿宋按照礼仪，双目注视地上，急步朝女王的宫殿走去。侍女们
打开宫门，热情地欢迎贵客。年轻的女使者把他一直领进女君主的内室。他在女
王面前的一把华丽的椅子上坐下。许珀茜柏勒低垂着头，脸颊上泛起一阵红晕。

    她以温柔而羞涩的声音说：" 异乡人，你们为什么缩在城外呢？雷姆诺斯城
里没有男人，你们一点也不用害怕。我们的丈夫不讲信义，背弃了我们。他们把
战争中抢来的色雷斯女人纳为小妾，并且移居到她们的故乡去了，还带走了儿子
和男佣，而我们却孤孤单单地被抛在这里。所以，我希望你们留在这里。假如你
愿意，你可以代替我坐我父亲的王位，做我们的头头。我们的王国是大海中最富
饶的岛屿，这地方你们一定会喜欢。希望你回去以后把我的建议告诉你的伙伴们，
你们别再停留在城外了。" 　　伊阿宋回答说：" 啊，女王，我们怀着感激的心
情接受你的帮助。我会把你的建议告诉我的同伴，我也愿意重新回到城里来。但
我们都不能接受王杖和岛屿，还是请你自己执掌吧！并不是我看不起它们，而是
在遥远的地方激烈的战争还在等待着我。" 他说完，伸出双手向女王告别，然后
急忙回到海边。　　妇女们即刻驾着快车，载着许多礼物，跟着伊阿宋赶来了。
船上的英雄们已经听到伊阿宋的解释，因此女人们很容易地说服他们进城并住进
她们的家里。伊阿宋直接住在宫里，其他人分住在这里那里，大家都很高兴。只
有赫拉克勒斯生来厌恶女色，仍然坚持跟少数几个伙伴留在船上。现在城内家家
欢宴，美酒飘香，欢歌笑语，舞影婆娑。献祭的烟火缭绕，袅袅地飘上云霄。女
人和客人都虔诚地膜拜岛屿的保护神赫斯托斯和他的妻子阿佛洛狄忒。出航的日
期一天天地拖延。要不是赫拉克勒斯忍不住从船上下来，催促他的伙伴们动身，
阿耳戈的英雄们就会一直留恋热情而又温顺的女人乐而忘返了！" 你们这些傻瓜，
" 他鄙视地说，" 难道你们国家的女人还不够你们享受吗？难道你们是为妻室才
到这里的？难道你们想要留在雷姆诺斯像农人一样地过日子吗？你们以为天上的
神}会取来金羊毛，放在我们脚下吗？我们干脆回去算了。按照我的意思，让伊
阿宋留在这里娶许珀茜柏勒为妻，生一大堆儿子，从此听凭别的英雄创立丰功伟
绩罢了！" 　　赫拉克勒斯生性倔强，没有人敢违抗他。众人收拾停当，准备出
航。

    城里的妇人们猜到了他们的意图，像群蜂一样涌来缠住他们，又是抱怨，又
是请求，哭哭啼啼，闹成一片。最后，她们不得不屈服于命运的安排。许珀茜柏
勒含泪走上前来，握住伊阿宋的手说：" 去吧，愿神}保佑你和你的伙伴，让你
们如愿以偿，取得金羊毛！等将来凯旋时你还愿意回来，这岛和我父亲的王杖仍
然等着你。我知道，你也许是不准备回来的，至少在远方想念我吧！" 　　伊阿
宋第一个回到船上，其他人也跟着他上了船。英雄们解下缆绳，摇动船桨。不久，
就把赫勒斯蓬托抛在了后面。

    从色雷斯来的风，把阿耳戈英雄们的大船，吹送到夫利基阿海岸。那里有一
座基奇科斯岛，岛上住着杜利奥纳人，他们的邻人是极其野蛮的土著巨人。这些
巨人有六条胳膊：宽阔的肩膀上各长一只胳膊，两腰又各长两条。　　杜利奥纳
人是海神的子孙，海神保护他们不受巨人的侵犯。他们的国王是虔诚的基奇科斯。

    他听说海上驶来一艘大船，便马上和全城人出来迎接阿耳戈英雄，并请他们
把船停在港口，因为国王曾经听到过一种神谕：如果有一队高贵的英雄前来，他
应该友好接待，千万不能和他们发生冲突。国王牢记神谕，所以热情地款待他们，
宰杀了许多牲口，并送上美酒，慷慨地帮助阿耳戈英雄。　　基奇科斯国王还是
个青年，才开始长出胡子。他的妻子染病在身，躺在王宫里。基奇科斯敬奉神}
的旨意，他把妻子安顿好，来跟异乡人一起食宴。阿耳戈英雄们告诉他出航的目
的和意图，他也给他们详细指点应走的路程。第二清晨，他们登上一座高山，观
察这岛在海上的方位，又欢赏了一番海天一色的美景。突然，一群巨人从四处涌
来，用巨大的山石把港口封堵起来，不让船只进出。阿耳戈船还留在港口，仍由
不愿上岸的赫勒克勒斯守卫，他看到来了一批巨人侵犯港口，便持弓搭箭，射死
了许多巨人。其他的英雄们闻讯赶来，用矛和弓箭把巨人们打得一败涂地，他们
如同砍伐下来的树木躺倒在港口周围。阿耳戈英雄们取得了胜利，又扬帆起航，
驶入大海。　　夜里，海上风向转了。阿耳戈英雄们还没明白过来，又被大风吹
回杜利奥纳海岸，他们还以为到了夫利基阿港呢！杜利奥纳人被登陆的嘈杂声从
睡梦中惊醒，急忙拿起武器挑战，认不清对方原来就是他们昨天隆重款待过的朋
友。

    双方展开了不幸的厮杀！伊阿宋英勇无比，亲手把长矛刺入慷慨而又虔诚的
国王基奇科斯的胸膛。杜利奥纳人逃回城内，紧闭城门。到第二天太阳升起，红
霞映天时，双方这才发现闹了一场可怕的误会。　　伊阿宋和他的英雄们看到国
王躺在血泊中，心中充满了无限的悲痛，接连三天，他们和杜利奥纳人一起哀悼
死者。

    最后，英雄们又扬帆出海了。国王的妻子克利特因忧伤过度而死。

    第二天清晨，太阳升起时，他们来到一个伸入大海的半岛附近，抛了锚，准
备休息。这里是珀布律喀亚王国，野蛮的国王阿密科斯在海岬旁有许多畜栏和房
屋。阿密科斯生性好斗，他规定外乡人必须和他进行拳击比赛，并要取胜，否则
不许离开他的王国。为此，许多人的性命断送在他的手里。阿耳戈英雄刚上岸，
他就朝他们走去，用挑衅的口吻嚷道：" 听着，你们这群海上的流浪者：外乡人
如果不和我赛拳并战胜我，就不许离开我的王国。你们赶快挑选一个最有本事的
人前来跟我比赛，否则我就要叫你们完蛋！" 　　在阿耳戈的英雄中，有一个希
腊最杰出的拳击手，名叫波吕丢刻斯，他是勒达的儿子。一听国王的挑战，他被
激怒了，跳上前去叫道：" 你别吓唬人，碰上我算你找对了人，" 珀布律喀亚国
王上下打量着这个勇士，眼珠子骨碌碌地转动着。可波吕丢刻斯微微一笑，显得
十分镇静。他伸出双手，试着挥动了一阵，看看它们是否因为长久掌舵而变得不
灵活了。当英雄们离开大船时，双方早已面对面地站好位置。国王的一个奴仆朝
他们丢下两副赛拳的皮套。　　" 随你挑吧，看哪一双适合你的手。" 阿密科斯
说，" 我用不了多久就能结果你！你马上就会亲身体验到我是一个最好的鞣革匠。

    " 　　波吕丢刻斯仍然默默地微笑着，拿起就近的一副手套，转过身来，让
朋友们套紧在双手上。珀布律喀亚国王也同样这样做了。拳击开始了。国王朝希
腊人奋力冲过来，连连出击，使波吕丢刻斯没有喘息和还手的机会。波吕丢刻斯
总是巧妙地躲过他的攻击，不让他的重拳落到身上。不一会，他就发现了对手的
弱点，于是伺机给他挥去重重的几拳。国王这才领略到对方的厉害。双方你一拳，
我一拳，咬牙切齿地格斗起来，直到两人都气喘吁吁，才站开来休息一下，深深
吸口气，擦去满头大汗。当他们重新交手的时候，阿密科斯一拳朝对方脑袋击去，
不料打空，只打中对方的肩膀。波吕丢刻斯却乘机挥拳击中国王的耳根，国王痛
得跪倒在地上。　　阿耳戈英雄们齐声欢呼。可是珀布律喀亚人急忙过来帮助国
王。

    他们挥舞棒棍和长矛，朝波吕丢刻斯冲了过来。阿耳戈英雄们也拔刀迎战，
护住了自己的朋友。一场血战后，珀布律喀亚人抵挡不住，被迫逃走，躲进城中，
不敢出来。英雄们涌入畜栏，抓到许多牲口，得到了丰富的战利品。夜晚，他们
就留在岸上，包扎伤口，向神}献祭，通宵欢乐地畅饮美酒。他们还从桂树上折
下树枝，编成花冠戴在头上。俄耳甫斯弹着琴，大家唱着赞美歌。当他们一起歌
颂波吕丢刻斯，宙斯的儿子，取得的胜利时，静静的海岸似乎也在高兴地侧耳倾
听。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-7：菲纽斯和妇人鸟

    施瓦布

    黎明时，他们饮宴才结束。阿耳戈英雄继续他们的航程。经历了几次冒险，
他们来到俾斯尼亚的对岸抛锚休息，英雄阿革诺耳的儿子菲纽斯住在这儿。因为
他滥用了阿波罗传授给他的预言的本领，所以到了晚年突然双目失明。那些丑陋
而讨厌的长着妖妇头的女人鸟，不让他安安静静地用餐。它们尽可能抢走他面前
的饭菜，又把剩下的饭菜弄脏，使他无法食用。但他一想到宙斯的一个神谕，便
感到十分欣慰，即北风神波瑞阿斯的儿子和希腊水手到来时，他就可以安静地进
餐。现在他听说来了一条船，便急忙离开住房来到岸边。他已经饿得皮包骨头，
活像一个影子了，衰弱得双腿颤抖，走起路来摇摇晃晃。当他来到阿耳戈英雄们
的面前时，已经累得精疲力竭，倒在地上。他们围住这个可怜的老人，看到他枯
槁的样子非常惊讶。老人苏醒过来，恳求他们：" 英雄们，如果你们真像神谕暗
示我的那样，是我的救星，那就赶快援助我吧。复仇女神不仅使我双目失明，而
且派来可怕的怪鸟抢劫和糟蹋我的食物。你们援助的不是一个外乡人，而是一个
希腊人，阿革诺耳的儿子菲纽斯，过去也是一个国王。能够救我脱离苦难的是波
瑞阿斯的儿子，他就是克勒俄帕特拉的弟弟，也是我的妻弟。原来北风神波瑞阿
斯曾因追求雅典国王厄瑞克透斯的女儿奥律蒂里阿遭到拒绝而发怒，把她从空中
带到遥远的色雷斯，住了下来，生下两个儿子策特斯和卡雷斯，还生了两个女儿
克勒俄帕特拉和茜欧纳。　　波瑞阿斯的儿子策特斯听到这话，马上扑进他的怀
里，并答应请他的兄弟们帮助，为国王驱除这些怪鸟。他们为他摆下一桌丰盛的
食物，他还没来得及进食，一群怪鸟一阵风似的从空中扑下来，贪婪地啄食。英
雄们大声么喝，可是它们无动于衷，仍然在餐桌上吞食，直到把一切都吞光，然
后飞上天空，留下一片令人无法忍受的恶臭。策特斯和卡雷斯拔剑追赶它们，宙
斯又借给他们双翼，赋予他们无尽的力量。他们越追越近，几乎伸手就能抓住它
们，并要砍断它们的脖子。突然，宙斯的使者伊里斯出现了，朝他们呼唤道："
喂，波瑞阿斯的儿子们，千万别杀死伟大的宙斯的猎犬――女人鸟。但我可以指
着斯提克斯河发誓：这些怪鸟再也不会折磨阿革诺耳的儿子了。" 　　策特斯和
卡雷斯听到这话，停止了追赶，返回船上。　　同时，希腊的英雄们正为年老的
菲纽斯准备圣餐，宴请这位饿得奄奄一息的国王。他贪婪地吞食着洁净而丰盛的
食物，好像这一切发生在梦中一样。到夜晚，当他们期待着波瑞阿斯的儿子回来
的时候，年迈的国王菲纽斯为感谢他们，便给他们说了一个预言。　　" 你们最
初将在塞诺斯狭窄的海峡中碰到撞岩，这是两座陡峭的山岩。它们不是从海底生
长的，而是从远方漂来的，有时海流将它们聚拢相撞，有时又将它们分开。两山
之间潮水奔腾，发出可怕的吼声。如果你们不想被挤碎，在经过两山之间时必须
用力地飞快划桨，让船像鸽子一样飞过。过了那里之后，你们会来到玛丽安蒂纳
海滨，那是通向地狱的入口。你们将经过许多山川、海湾、亚马孙女人国和汗流
满面地从地下挖掘铁矿的卡律贝尔人的地方。最后，你们将到达科尔喀斯海滨，
宽阔的法瑞斯河的湍急水流从那儿淌入大海。最后你们将看见埃厄忒斯国王的宏
伟的城堡，就在那里有一条从不睡觉的巨龙看守着悬挂在栎树树冠上的金羊毛。

    " 　　他们听了老人的话，心里不寒而栗。他们正想询问别的问题，波瑞阿
斯的两个儿子已经从空中降落在他们中间。他们给国王带来了伊里斯的口信，国
王听了十分欣慰。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-8：两座巨大的撞岩

    施瓦布

    菲纽斯充满感激之情，依依不舍地同他们告别。阿耳戈的英雄们又踏上了新
的冒险旅途。起初，因海上刮起了西北风，接连十天他们无法航行，直到向所有
的十二名神}祭献和虔诚地祈祷后，才得到保佑，重新加速航行。不一会，他们
听到远方传来雷鸣般的巨响，这是附近海面上浮动的两座巨大的撞岩互相撞击发
出的轰响，伴和着海岸上的巨大的回音和海浪的呼啸声。提费斯在舵旁细心观察，
把稳船舵。年轻的奥宇弗莫斯从船舱里站起来，手上托着一只鸽子。菲纽斯曾经
预言，如果鸽子能够无所畏惧地从两座撞岩间飞过，那么他们就可以放心地前进。

    两座巨岩刚刚分开的时候，奥宇弗莫斯急忙放出鸽子。大家满怀期待地注视
着。

    鸽子正飞过去，两座巨岩又开始互相靠近。海水在海峡中掀起巨浪，海空都
在咆哮，两座漂浮的巨岩快要靠在一起了，只给鸽子留下一线飞越的空间。鸽子
扇动翅膀，终于安全地飞了过去，撞合的岩石夹掉了鸽子的尾羽。于是，提费斯
高声地鼓励划桨的英雄乘巨岩分开之机奋勇划去。海水把船一下吸了进去，船随
着水流向前。灾难威胁着他们。一阵巨浪排山倒海似的席卷而来，英雄们不禁倒
抽一口气，急忙埋下头来。提费斯镇定自如，下令停止摇桨。巨浪翻滚着冲入船
底，把船高高托起，高过了正在合拢的巨岩。现在，他们齐心协力，拚命划桨，
船桨都弯似弓了。突然，漩涡又把船扯进悬岩中间，岩石差点擦到船身。要不是
雅典娜暗中悄悄地推了一把，他们的船就会被撞得粉碎。不过，撞合的岩石还是
夹住了船尾的几块木板。木板被压成碎片掉进海里，瞬间就被冲走了，消失得无
影无踪。　　当他们重新见到蓝天和空旷的大海时，才轻松地舒了一口气。他们
真觉得自己像是从地狱里逃出来似的。　　" 这不是由于我们的力量才取得成功
的！

    " 提费斯大声说，" 是雅典娜助了我们一臂之力。现在我们再也用不着害怕
了，因为根据菲纽斯的预言，我们以后碰到的其他险阻都能轻松地闯过！" 但伊
阿宋却悲伤地摇了摇头说：" 善良的提费斯啊，当珀利阿斯说服我担负此任时，
这倒使神}们为难了。其实我倒愿意当时被他剁成碎块！现在我日日夜夜为你们
的生命担忧。我能够使你们免除危险，带领你们平安地回到家乡吗？" 　　伊阿
宋说这话，只是试试他的同伴们的心。但他们都热烈地向他欢呼，要求继续前进。

    他们又精神饱满地继续航行，终于来到忒耳莫冬河的入海口。这条河同世界
上其他河流都不同，它发源于深山之中的一处泉水，流了一段后分成九十六条支
流，奔流入海。亚马孙人就住在一条最宽的河流入海处。这个民族全是妇女，是
战神阿瑞斯的后裔，生性好战。阿耳戈英雄们如果从这里登陆，那么毫无疑问跟
亚马孙妇女们会有一场血战，因为她们能与善战的英雄们匹敌。她们不是住在城
里，而是分成许多部落，散居在乡村。　　一阵西风吹来，使船改变了航向，阿
耳戈英雄们避开了好战的亚马孙女人。经过一天一夜的航行，如同菲纽斯预言的
那样，他们到达卡律贝尔王国。这儿的人既不务农，也不放牧，整天在荒凉的土
地里采掘铁矿，以此与邻国的人交换食品。他们在阴暗的地窖和浓密的烟雾中艰
苦地劳动，过着没有欢乐的日子。　　阿耳戈英雄们到达阿瑞蒂亚，或称阿瑞岛
的时候，一只鸟儿扇动翅膀飞临大船上空，射出一根尖尖的羽毛箭，击中英雄俄
琉斯的肩头。俄琉斯痛得倒在船舱里，不能继续划桨。他的同伴们给他拔出羽毛，
包扎伤口。他们看到这样的飞箭十分奇怪。不一会儿又飞来第二只鸟。克吕蒂沃
斯弯弓搭箭，一箭射去，飞鸟应声落下，掉在船上。" 看来岛屿近在眼前了！"
富有航海经验的安菲达姆斯说，" 别理这些鸟儿。它们一定很多，假如我们登陆，
可没有这么多箭去射杀它们。让我们想个办法，驱逐这些好斗的飞鸟。我建议你
们都戴上插有高高羽饰的头盔，再用闪亮的长矛和盾牌装点在船上，然后大声吼
叫。

    鸟儿听到叫声，看到头盔上的羽毛，尖锐的长矛，闪光的盾牌，一定会吓得
飞走的。" 　　英雄们称赞这是一个好主意，他们全都照他的建议做了。他们再
没有看到一只鸟。当他们临近海岛，并撞击矛和盾发出一阵阵轰轰的声响时，无
数受了惊吓的鸟儿从岸上飞起，掠过船的上方，像乌云一样。阿耳戈的英雄们用
盾牌护住自己，鸟儿尖锐的羽翎飞蝗似地落下来，却无法伤害他们。这些惊恐的
可怕的鸟儿穿过大海，远远飞到对面的海岸上。阿耳戈的英雄们登上了海岛。　
　在这里，他们意外地遇到了朋友和伙伴。他们上岸走了没几步，遇到了迎面走
来的四位衣衫褴褛的年轻人。其中一个匆匆向他们走来，打着招呼说：" 好心的
人啊，不论你们是谁，请帮帮我们这些可怜的落难人吧，给我们一点衣服穿，再
给我们一点食物充饥！" 　　伊阿宋友好地答应给他们帮助，并问起他们的姓名
和身世。

    " 你们一定听到过关于佛里克索斯的故事，他是阿塔玛斯和涅斐勒的儿子。
" 这个年轻人回答说，" 你们知道，他把金羊毛带到了科尔喀斯，是吗？国王埃
厄忒斯把大女儿卡尔契俄珀许配给他，我们就是他的儿子。我的名字叫阿耳戈斯，
我们的父亲佛里克索斯不久前去世了。我们根据他的遗嘱，航海去取他留在俄耳
科墨诺斯城的宝物。" 　　听了这话，英雄们非常高兴。伊阿宋立即认他们为堂
兄弟，因为他的祖父阿塔玛斯和克瑞透斯是亲兄弟。这几个小伙子继续说到他们
的船怎样遭到风浪而沉没，他们怎样抱着一块船板，漂流到这无人救助的岛屿。
阿耳戈英雄们把他们出海的意图告诉他们，希望他们加入他们的队伍，一起去冒
险。

    他们一听，惊恐得瞪大了眼睛。" 我们的外祖父埃厄忒斯是个残酷的人，据
说是太阳神的儿子，具有非凡的力量。他统治着科尔喀斯地方的无数种族，而金
羊毛旁边还有一条可怕的巨龙看守着。" 听到这些，英雄们有几个顿时怕得脸色
都变了。但埃阿科斯的儿子珀琉斯霍地站起来说：" 你们别以为我们会败在科尔
喀斯国王的手下，别忘了我们也是神}的子孙！如果他不把金羊毛乖乖地交给我
们，我们就把它抢走！" 接着，他们举行丰盛的宴会，在用餐时又互相鼓励，更
增添了勇气。　　第二天清晨，佛里克索斯的儿子们穿着新衣，吃饱喝足，然后
到了船上，阿耳戈船又扬帆出航了。经过一昼夜的航行，他们看到了高加索的山
峰隐隐约约地耸立在海面上。等到暮色降临时，他们听到空中鸟儿急飞的声音，
那是去啄食普罗米修斯肝脏的苍鹰。它在船的上方的空中飞翔，猛烈地扇动强健
的翅膀，掀起一阵阵大风，鼓起了船帆。一会儿，他们听到远方传来普罗米修斯
的呻吟声，因为雄鹰正在啄食他的肝脏。又过了一阵，呻吟声消失了。他们看到
苍鹰在高空中扇动着翅膀，往回飞去。　　就在当天夜晚，他们到达了目的地，
即法瑞斯河的出海口。有几个人高兴地攀上桅杆，卸下船帆，然后用桨把船划到
宽阔的河面上，溯流而上，波浪似乎都在船前绕开了道路。他们看到船的左边是
高加索山和科尔喀斯王国的都城基泰阿。右面是广袤的田野和阿瑞斯的圣林。在
那里，一条巨龙瞪大不眠的眼睛，看守着挂在栎树冠上的金羊毛。现在伊阿宋站
起来，端着盛满酒的金杯，高举起来，浇祭河流和大地母亲，祭奠诸位神}以及
在途中死去的英雄们。他请求诸神帮助，保护阿耳戈船。　　" 现在我们已经平
安地来到达科尔喀斯，" 舵手安克奥斯说，" 现在是我们该认真地商量一下的时
候了，到底是友好地央求埃厄忒斯，还是用其他办法来实现我们的目的。""明天
再说吧！

    " 疲倦的英雄们叫道。伊阿宋当即吩咐把船停在荫凉的河湾里。他们一躺下
就睡着了。但睡了没多长时间天就亮了，早晨的阳光把他们唤醒了。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-9：伊阿宋在埃厄忒斯的宫殿里

    施瓦布

    清晨，阿耳戈英雄们正在商量，伊阿宋站立起来说：" 我有个建议：大家都
安静地留在船上，不过得拿着武器，作好准备。我想带佛里克索斯的四个儿子，
另外再从你们之中挑选二人，一起上国王埃厄忒斯的宫殿去。我要婉言问他，是
否愿意把金羊毛交给我们。毫无疑问，他会拒绝我们的要求，但这样做所发生的
一切后果，都必须由他负责。谁知道呢，也许我们的劝说能够使他改变主意。上
次他不是也曾被人说服，同意收留从后母那儿逃出来的无辜的佛里克索斯吗？"
年轻的英雄们同意伊阿宋的建议。于是，他手持赫耳墨斯的和平杖，带着佛里克
索斯的儿子们和他的同伴忒拉蒙和厄利斯国王奥革阿斯离开大船。他们踏上一块
长满着柳树的田野。他们看到树上吊着许多用链子捆着的尸体，感到很恐怖。

    但死者生前不是罪犯，也不是被杀害的外乡人。在科尔喀斯有个风俗，死去
的男人不许火化或者土葬，而要用生牛皮裹起来，吊在远离城市的树上，让尸体
风干。

    只有妇女死后才埋葬入土。　　科尔喀斯是一个人数众多的民族。为了让伊
阿宋和他的同伴不被居民发现，阿耳戈英雄的保护女神降下浓雾把他们遮掩起来。
直到他们进入宫殿后，雾才消散。他们站在宫殿的前院，看着厚实的宫墙，巍峨
的大门和雄伟的立柱，都感到惊讶不已。整个建筑围了一道凸出的石墙。他们悄
悄地跨过前院的大门，看到上面攀满葡萄藤的亭子和四股常流不息的喷泉。奇怪
的是一股喷出牛奶，一股喷出葡萄酒，一股喷出香油，最后一股喷出冬暖夏凉的
水。

    这是技艺高超的赫淮斯托斯为国王精工制成的。他还制造了口中喷火的铜牛
和坚固的铁犁。赫淮斯托斯将这些工艺品全部献给埃厄忒斯的父亲太阳神，感谢
太阳神在与巨人之战中救出了他，让他躲进太阳车里逃跑。　　他们由前院走进
中院。

    两旁廊柱，从左右分开，通往许多宫室和林荫道。阿耳戈英雄们往前走时，
看到几座相对的宫殿。一座宫殿里住着国王埃厄忒斯，另一座宫殿里住着他的儿
子阿布绪米托斯，其余的住着宫女和国王的女儿卡尔契俄珀和美狄亚。小女儿美
狄亚平常很少露面，因为她是赫卡忒神庙的女祭司，常常住在神庙里。但这天早
晨，希腊人的保护女神赫拉却使她留在宫殿里。正当她离开自己的房间，准备去
姐姐那里时，在途中突然碰到了这些英雄们。她惊叫起来，卡尔契俄珀听到叫声，
急忙开门出来，却突然失声欢叫起来，因为她看到面前站着自己的四个儿子。他
们立即扑入母亲的怀抱。母子五人重新团聚，真是悲喜交集。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-10 ：美狄亚和埃厄忒斯

    施瓦布

    埃厄忒斯和他的王后厄伊底伊亚也闻声赶来。不一会，大院里挤满了人，一
片欢腾。奴仆们有的为款待客人忙着宰杀一头大公牛，有的劈木柴，生火，还有
的在忙着烧水。正当大家忙忙碌碌的时候，爱神却高高地飞翔在空中，从箭袋中
抽出一支箭，然后悄无声息地降落下来，蹲在伊阿宋的身后，瞄准国王的女儿美
狄亚。谁也没有发现飞箭，连美狄亚也没看见，她只觉得心口一阵灼痛，不时地
深深吸着气，然后偷偷地抬头注视着伊阿宋。她不再想别的事，心中充满甜蜜的
痛苦，脸上羞得绯红。　　在欢乐的嘈杂声中，没有人发现美狄亚的心事。仆人
们端上佳肴美酒，阿耳戈英雄们已经沐浴更衣，高高兴兴地在餐桌旁坐下，享用
丰盛的美食，并且畅饮起来。席间，埃厄忒斯的外孙叙述了途中的遭遇，国王乘
机悄悄向他打听这些外乡人的情况。" 我不想对你隐瞒，外祖父，" 阿耳戈斯附
在他的耳后低声说，" 这些人是为了金羊毛才来找你的。有个国王想把他们赶出
他们的国土，因此派给他们这个危险的任务。他希望这批英雄会惹起宙斯的愤怒，
招致佛里克索斯的报复。帕拉斯。雅典娜帮助他们建造了一条坚固的大船，这船
经得起惊涛骇浪。　　全希腊的英雄们都勇敢地集合在这条船上。" 　　国王听
到这些吃了一惊，十分恨他的外孙们。他认为一定是他们引来了这么多的外乡人，
进了他的王宫大院。国王眼睛里充满着怒火，大声地说：" 你们这批叛徒，滚出
去，别让我看见你们！你们不是来取金羊毛，而是来抢我的王杖和王位的。要不
是你们远道而来，做了我的宾客，我今天真的不会饶了你们！" 　　坐在国王边
上的忒拉蒙，听到这话，十分生气，正想站起来回骂国王，但伊阿宋及时阻止了
他，温和地说：" 埃厄忒斯，请你放心，我们来到你的城里，进了你的王宫，并
不是来抢劫的。谁愿意漂泊过海，经历如此险恶的航程，前来夺取别人的财产，
让自己致富呢？是可怜的命运和暴君的命令把我推上了这条路。你如果把金羊毛
送给我，全希腊人都会因此而称赞你，我们也一定会报答你的好意。如果你遇上
战事，那么就可以把我们看作你的盟友，我们将为你而战！" 　　伊阿宋说这些
话，是想和国王和解，而国王却在暗暗思忖究竟是即刻把他们杀死，还是先试试
他们的力量。他细细想了一会，觉得后一个办法比较合适，于是渐渐地平静下来，
说：" 何必如此胆怯呢？如果你们真是神}的子孙，那么就有本事把金羊毛取回
去。我喜欢勇敢的男子汉，愿意把一切都赏赐给他们。可是你们如何才能向我显
示你们的本事和力量呢？我有两只神牛在阿瑞斯的田地里吃草：它们有着铜蹄，
鼻中喷火。我习惯用这两头牛耕地，当土地全耕好后，我在垅沟里撒下的不是谷
物，而是播种可怕的龙牙。而收获的是一群男人，他们从四面八方朝我涌来，我
必须挥动长矛，把他们一个个刺倒在地。每天，我清晨给牛套上轭具耕种，直到
晚上收获后我才能休息。外乡人，如果你能够像我一样，当天完成这件事，那么
你就可以带走金羊毛。否则我是不能给你的，因为勇敢的男子汉是不畏艰难和险
阻的。" 伊阿宋默默地坐在那儿，拿不定主意，因为他不敢冒昧答应做一件恐怖
的冒险事。后来，他坚定地说：" 不管这任务多么艰巨，我愿意经受考验。国王，
我愿意为此而死。对一个凡人来说，难道还有比死更糟糕的吗？命运把我送到这
里，我愿意听从命运的安排。" 　　" 好吧，" 国王说，" 你可以去告诉你的同
伴们。但要好好考虑！如果你完不成任务，那么干脆还是让我去干，并且尽快离
开我的国土！"

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-11 ：阿耳戈斯的建议

    施瓦布

    伊阿宋和两位同伴立即从座位上站起身来，佛里克索斯的儿子中只有阿耳戈
斯愿意跟他们走，他们离开了宫殿。美狄亚的目光透过面纱注视着伊阿宋，她的
灵魂早已跟着他一路去了。当她重新回到自己的房间时，她不禁淌下了眼泪，自
言自语地说：" 我干吗悲伤呢？这位英雄跟我有什么相干呢？无论他是最显赫的
英雄，还是最糟糕的胆小鬼，甚至他命该死去，这都是他的事情。可是，唉，但
愿他能逃脱厄运！仁慈的女神赫卡忒，保佑他平安回家吧！如果他注定要被神牛
制服的话，那么也该让他预先知道，至少我为他可怕的命运感到担心！" 　　美
狄亚正感到烦恼的时候，阿耳戈的英雄们正走在回船的路上，阿耳戈斯对伊阿宋
说：" 你也许不赞成我的建议，不过我还是愿意告诉你。我认识一位姑娘，她从
地狱女神赫卡忒那儿学会了调制魔汤。如果我们能够争取她的援助，那么我敢肯
定你准能胜利地完成这项任务。只要你愿意，我将去试试，争取得到她的支持。

    " 　　" 如果你愿意去的话，我的朋友，" 伊阿宋说，" 我不会阻止你。可
是我们得依靠一个女人才能回去，那听起来多不好听。" 　　说话间他们已经来
到船上，伊阿宋告诉同伴们他对国王作的承诺。好一会儿他的朋友们坐在那里没
吭声。

    最后，珀琉斯站起来打破了沉默。他说：" 伊阿宋，如果你想履行你的诺言，
那就请你准备吧！如果你觉得没把握，那就干脆别去做。可是，在这种情况下，
你要知道，你的朋友们面临的结局只有死亡，没有别的了。" 　　忒拉蒙和另外
四个伙伴忍不住跳了起来，一想到这是一场艰难的冒险，就感到亢奋，渴求拼杀
一场。阿耳戈斯使他们安静下来，继续说：" 我认识一位姑娘，她擅长魔法。她
是我的母亲的妹妹，让我去说服母亲，争取那位姑娘的支持。到那时候，我们才
能谈得上讨论伊阿宋如何去完成他的任务。" 　　他的话刚说完，突然出现了一
种预兆：一只被秃鹰追赶的鸽子，扑进伊阿宋的怀里，俯冲下来的秃鹰却像石头
一样掉在船尾的甲板上。看到这情景，一位英雄突然想起，年迈的菲纽斯的预言，
阿佛洛狄忒将会帮助他们返回家园。因此除了阿法洛宇斯的儿子伊达斯外，所有
的人都同意阿耳戈斯的计划。伊达斯暴躁地说：" 天哪，难道我们到这里来只是
为了当女人的奴仆吗？我们为什么不找阿瑞斯，却找阿佛洛狄忒呢？难道一只鸽
子就会使我们免于战争吗？" 许多英雄都附合他的意见，低声地交头接耳，可是
伊阿宋却同意阿耳戈斯的意见。大船靠岸停泊，英雄们在船上等着阿耳戈斯回来。

    阿耳戈斯找到了母亲，请她说服她妹妹美狄亚帮助希腊英雄。卡尔契俄珀十
分同情这些外乡人，可是她不敢触怒父亲。现在看到儿子恳切央求，便答应帮助
他们。　　美狄亚烦躁不安地躺在床上，她做了一个噩梦，梦见伊阿宋正准备跟
公牛搏斗，但目的不是为了金羊毛，而是为了要娶美狄亚为妻，把她带回家乡。

    但跟公牛展开生死搏斗的是她自己，她战胜了公牛。不料她的父亲却失信了，
拒绝履行事先对伊阿宋许下的诺言，因为应当由他而不是由她制服神牛。为此他
父亲和这位外乡人发生了激烈的争执，双方都推她当公断人。她却袒护外乡人。
她的父母痛哭流泪，突然间大叫起来――美狄亚也就从梦中惊醒了。　　醒来后，
她急着想去找她的姐姐。可是她由于犹豫不决，在前厅徘徊了好一阵。她四次想
走进去，可又四次缩了回来。最后，她痛苦地扑在自己的床上哭了起来。她的贴
身的女仆看到她在流泪，十分同情她，急忙跑去告诉卡尔契俄珀。她一听，连忙
赶到妹妹这儿，看到她双手蒙面在哭泣，便关心地问：" 发生什么事了？你病了
吗？"

    施瓦布

    美狄亚听了姐姐的询问，羞得脸上泛起一阵红晕。她欲言又止，最后爱情使
她鼓起勇气。她巧妙地绕了一个弯子，机敏地说：" 卡尔契俄珀，我心里难受，
是为你的儿子担忧，我怕父亲会把他们和外乡人一起杀掉，一个可怕的梦给了我
这个预感。但愿神}保佑，不让梦里的事实现。" 　　卡尔契俄珀听了很吃惊。

    " 我正是为了这件事来找你的，" 她说，" 我请求你支持他们，反对我们的
父亲！

    " 她抱住美狄亚的双膝，把头靠在她的怀里。姐妹俩都悲伤地哭泣起来。这
时美狄亚说：" 我指着天地，对你起誓：为了拯救你的儿子，只要我能做的，我
都乐意去做。" 　　" 那么，" 姐姐接过话说，" 为了我的孩子，你也应该给那
位异乡人一些魔药，让他能在那场可怕的决斗中幸运地保全生命。我的儿子阿耳
戈斯以他的名义请求我，希望得到你的帮助。" 　　美狄亚的心高兴得激烈地跳
动起来，脸上泛出红晕，不由自主地说：" 卡尔契俄珀，如果我不把保全你和你
的儿子的生命当作我最关心的事，那么就让我活不到明早。明天我将一早就去赫
卡忒神殿，把制服神牛的魔药取给那个外乡人。" 卡尔契俄珀离开了妹妹的住房，
赶紧给阿耳戈斯送去这个值得庆幸的消息。　　整整一夜，美狄亚同自己进行着
激烈的斗争。" 我是否许诺得太多了？" 她问着自己，" 为了一个外乡人，我用
得着花费这么大的精力吗？是啊，我应当救他一命，让他去他心中所愿去的地方。

    可是，他事情成功之日，却是我的死期，到那时恶毒的流言会攻击我，说我
不惜有辱门庭去为一个外乡人殉情。那流言该是多么可怕啊！" 她从房里取出一
只小箱子，里面放着还魂药和致死药，她把箱子放在膝盖上，打开盖子正想尝尝
致死药的滋味，突然想到生之欢乐和甜美。她觉得太阳也好像比以前更美丽。她
的心里充满了对死的恐惧。美狄亚把箱子盖上，放在地上。这时伊阿宋的保护女
神赫拉改变了她的心绪。她几乎等不到天亮就取来所许诺的魔药，并带着它到她
所喜爱的英雄那儿去。

    天刚破晓，美狄亚一骨碌从床上跳下来。扎好由于悲伤披散在肩头的金发，
擦去脸上的泪痕，涂上花蜜般的香膏。夜间的悲哀都已消失。她轻手轻脚走过大
厅，吩咐十二个女仆给她套车，送她到赫卡忒神殿。同时，她从小盒子里取出一
种叫做普罗米修斯油的药膏。如果有人祈求地狱女神后，用这种药膏涂抹全身，
那他在当天就能刀枪不入，火烧不伤，并能战胜任何敌人。这种药膏是用一种树
根的黑汁制成的。树根吮吸了普罗米修斯的肝脏滴入地里的血，因此才含有黑汁。

    美狄亚亲自取了这种植物的宝贵的黑汁，把它盛在贝壳里。　　马车套好后，
两个侍女和她们的女主人一起上了车。美狄亚亲自执着缰绳和马鞭，驱车出城，
其余的女侍们在车后步行。行人都恭恭敬敬地避到一旁，为国王的女儿让路。美
狄亚来到神殿，跳下车来，想了片刻，对侍女们说：" 女友们，我想我犯下了罪
孽，因为没有避开这些外乡人。我姐姐和她的儿子阿耳戈斯要求我帮助他们的头
领制服神牛，并用魔药使他免遭伤害。我假装答应了，并且约他到神殿里来，单
独与他会面，那是为了得到他的礼物，过后我再分给你们。其实我要给他毒药，
让他完蛋。现在你们都走开，以免他产生怀疑。" 侍女们对这狡猾的计划都感到
满意，她们遵照吩咐走开了。　　阿耳戈斯和他的朋友伊阿宋带着预言家莫珀索
斯一路赶来。今天赫位使伊阿宋更加英俊。美狄亚不时地从门里朝外张望，一听
到脚步声或风声，她都急忙抬起头来探望。伊阿宋和他的朋友终于跨进了神庙。
他高大威武，犹如大海中升起的天狼星一样，神采奕奕。姑娘猛地看到英雄，连
呼吸都停住了，直觉得眼前变黑了，双颊一阵发热，心慌意乱得不知道如何是好。
伊阿宋和美狄亚面对面地站着，沉默了好一会儿。最后伊阿宋打破了沉默。" 为
什么你见到我害怕呢？我是来请求援助的。请把答应你姐姐的魔药给我吧，我迫
切需要你的帮助。不过请别忘记，我们是在一个神圣的地方，任何的欺骗在这儿
都是罪孽。我们阿耳戈英雄的母亲和妻子们也许在悲悼我们的命运，你的援助将
免除她们的忧虑和痛苦。那样，你将受到希腊人的尊重，他们将会把你当作神}
."美狄亚默默地听他说完，微笑着低垂着眼帘，为受到他的称赞而高兴。许多话
涌到嘴边，她恨不得把心事告诉他！可是她还是一声不吭，只是解开包巾，取出
小盒子，伊阿宋连忙从她手中接了过去。她多么希望乘机把她的心也一起交给他，
如果他需要的话。他们都害羞地垂下眼帘，然后，两人又相对而视，渴求的目光
交织在一起，激起多少爱慕的火花。过了许久，尽了最大努力，美狄亚才说出话
来。" 听着，我将告诉你如何做。在我父亲把龙牙交给你，让你去播种之后，你
先在河水里沐浴，然后穿上黑衣，在地上挖一个圆形土坑，填上一堆木柴，杀一
头小羊羔，架在木柴堆上烧成灰，再用甜甜的蜂蜜给赫卡忒祭献一杯饮料，等这
一切做完以后再离开木柴堆。可是，你听见身后的脚步声或狗吠声，你不能回头。

    否则献祭不会有用。第二天清晨，你用我给你的魔药涂抹全身。它会给你无
穷的力量，你不仅能与人类，甚至能与神}匹敌，你还应该把你的长矛、宝剑和
盾牌也抹上膏油样的魔药，这一来你就能刀枪不入，神牛喷出的火也无法烧伤你。
当然，这些只能在当天有效。你就在那一天去战斗。我还可以给你其他的帮助。
当你套上神牛，耕遍了土地，种下龙牙，并看到龙牙破土而出的时候，别忘记往
里面扔一块大石头。他们将会激烈地争夺石头，就像一群疯狗争食一块面包一样。

    你应该乘机冲进去，把他们杀死。然后你就可以毫不费力地从科尔喀斯取回
金羊毛，离开这里！对，从此以后，你可以离开这里，到你所喜欢的地方去。"
她一边说，一边淌下了眼泪，因为她想到这位外乡人又要航海远去，感到很悲伤。

    她握住他的右手，因为心里的悲痛已使她忘形了。" 你回去以后，别忘掉美
狄亚。

    我也会想念你的。告诉我，要回去的地方在哪儿？是啊！你将和你的伙伴们
乘坐美丽的船回到那儿去了。" 　　伊阿宋感到自己已经控制不住感情了，他心
里深深地爱着美狄亚，于是他急切地说：" 请相信我，高贵的公主！我只要能够
逃离大难，将会日日夜夜地怀念你。我的家乡在帖撒利的爱俄尔卡斯，那是普罗
米修斯的儿子丢卡利翁建造了许多城市和庙宇的地方。在那里，人们还不知道你
们的国家叫什么名字。" 　　" 啊，这么说你住在希腊，" 她说。" 希腊人要比
我们这里的人慷慨大方。因此，别告诉他们你在这里的遭遇，只是在你孤独时默
默地怀念我吧！即使这里的人全都把你忘掉了，我也会想念你的。假如你忘记了
我，那么让爱俄尔卡斯的风吹来一只小鸟，通过它我会使你知道你是通过我的帮
助才逃离厄运的！唉，我多么愿意亲自来到你的家乡，亲自提醒你一声啊！" 说
到这里，姑娘的眼泪像断了线的珍珠滚落下来。　　" 你在说什么呀？" 伊阿宋
回答说，" 让你的风吹走吧，让你的鸟飞走吧！假如你跟我一起回到希腊，一起
回到我的故乡，那里的男男女女都会尊重你，把你当神}一样崇拜，因为由于你，
他们的儿子、兄弟和丈夫才逃脱了死亡。而你，将属于我，除了死神以外，谁也
不能把我们的爱分离！" 　　美狄亚听到这话感到十分幸福，但同时又隐隐地感
觉到，要离开自己的祖国，那是多么可怕。不过她还是渴望到希腊去，那是因为
赫拉已把这种渴望埋在她的心里。女神希望美狄亚离开科尔喀斯到爱俄尔卡斯去，
并帮助伊阿宋戳穿珀利阿斯的阴谋。　　这时，侍女们在门外焦急地等待着。时
间过得很快，美狄亚早就该回去了。要不是细心的伊阿宋提醒她，她也许还真的
忘掉回家了呢。" 时间到了，你该回去了，" 伊阿宋说，" 否则别人会疑心的。

    让我们以后在这里再见面吧。"

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-14 ：伊阿宋完成了埃厄忒斯的使命

    施瓦布

    伊阿宋满怀喜悦地回到船上，见到了同伴们。美狄亚也朝女仆们走去，她们
连忙迎了过来，但美狄亚却一点儿也没有注意到她们焦灼的神色，因为她的灵魂
好像浮在云雾里似的。她轻捷地登上车，催动马把车一直拉到宫中。卡尔契俄珀
焦虑地在宫殿里等了很久，她托着低垂的头，坐在一张小凳上，正为儿子的命运
担忧。　　这时，伊阿宋兴奋地告诉同伴们，美狄亚已经把魔药交给了他。阿耳
戈英雄们都很高兴，只有伊达斯气得咬牙切齿。第二天早晨，他们派了两个人到
埃厄忒斯那儿去取龙牙。国王把几颗龙牙交给了他们，这正是被底比斯国王卡德
摩斯杀死的那条龙的牙齿。国王毫不担心，因为他相信伊阿宋绝对对付不了神牛，
完不成播种龙牙的任务，也休想保住自己的命。这天夜里，伊阿宋在河水里沐浴。

    他按照美狄亚的吩咐，又给赫卡忒献祭。女神听到他的祈祷，从洞府中出来，
头上盘着一群丑恶的毒龙，举着熊熊燃烧的栎树枝。地狱的猎犬狂吠着围着她转
来转去。伊阿宋十分害怕，可是他没有忘记恋人的吩咐，头也不回地往前走去。
他一回到船上，又跟同伴们在一起。这时高加索的雪顶上映着一抹朝霞，新的一
天开始了。　　埃厄忒斯穿上结实的铠甲，这身铠甲上次他同巨人作战时穿过。
他头上戴着四羽金盔，手中拿着四层牛皮的盾牌。这盾牌很重，除了他和赫拉克
勒斯以外，几乎无人能够举起。他的儿子给他牵来快马。他登上马车，如飞似地
驰过城区，后面跟着一大批人。国王只是想作为一个旁观者去观战，但还是愿意
全身披挂，好像亲自临阵一样。　　伊阿宋遵照美狄亚的吩咐，用魔油涂抹了长
矛、宝剑和盾牌。他的同伴们在他周围舞着枪，每个人都想跟他的长矛较量一下，
但矛坚如山，无法将它弄弯。伊达斯十分恼怒，挥剑朝矛柄狠狠一击，但剑被弹
了回来。英雄们看到后，欢呼雀跃。伊阿宋又用神油把自己的身体涂抹了一遍。
他突然感到四肢增添了无比的力量。同伴们摇船送他们的首领到阿瑞斯田野，国
王埃厄忒斯率领一群人正在等待着他们。船靠岸，停好后，伊阿宋首先跳上岸，
他手执长矛、盾牌，随即接过国王递给他的盛着尖硬龙牙的头盔。他把宝剑用一
根皮带斜挂在肩膀上，威风凛凛朝田野走去。地上放着套牛耕田用的轭犁和犁头，
全是铁铸的。他细细地观察了这些工具，然后把枪头紧紧扎在长矛柄上，并放下
头盔，然后手持盾牌，朝前走去，寻找神牛，不料关在地洞里的神牛却突然从另
一端的地下钻了出来，向他冲来。它们鼻孔里喷射着火焰，全身笼罩在烟雾中。

    伊阿宋的同伴们看到像怪物似的神牛冲来，都怕得发颤。但伊阿宋却镇定自
若，张开双腿站定，把盾牌放在身前，等待神牛的进攻。牛低着头，昂着角，呼
啸着朝他奔来，可是激烈的冲击并没有使伊阿宋后退半步。现在，神牛退回几步，
咆哮着跳起双腿，鼻孔里喷着火焰，又狠狠向他冲击。伊阿宋岿然不动，姑娘的
魔药保护了他。突然，他看准机会，一把抓住牛角，用尽力气，把牛拖到放轭具
的地方，并踢着它的铁蹄，迫使它跪倒在地上。然后他又用同样的方法制服了第
二头牛。这时，他扔下盾牌，冒着公牛喷吐的烈火，双手按住跪在地上的两头神
牛。不管公牛力气多大，现在一点也动弹不得。看到这里，埃厄忒斯也不禁惊叹
这位外乡人的神力。卡斯托尔和波吕丢刻斯兄弟俩如同事先商量好的那样，把地
上的轭具给他，随即飞快地跳开。他敏捷地将它紧紧套在牛脖子上，然后套上铁
犁。　　伊阿宋重新拾起盾牌，把它用皮带挂在背上，然后拿起装满龙牙的头盔，
手执长矛，用枪尖抵着暴怒的神牛拉犁耕田。地上犁出了深沟，土地在沟里翻起
砸碎。伊阿宋一步步地跟在后面播下龙牙，同时又小心地注视身后，看看毒龙的
子孙是否已破土而出，并朝着他扑来。神牛使劲拖着犁踏着铁蹄前进。下午，整
块土地全部耕完了。伊阿宋解下牛轭，扬起武器猛地一挥，神牛吓得一溜烟地逃
了回去。　　伊阿宋看到垄沟里还没有长出龙的子孙，就回到船上，准备休息。

    同伴们围着他，高声向他欢呼。可是他却默不作声，只是用头盔盛满河水，
畅饮起来，以解烈火般的干渴。他觉得双腿又充满力量，心里重新满怀着斗争的
欲望。

    现在地里冒出了巨人。阿瑞斯的田野里长枪和盾牌闪耀着银光。伊阿宋想起
聪明的美狄亚的话，便举起一块巨大的圆石，远远地扔在巨人的中间，然后悄悄
地蹲下，用盾牌掩护自己。科尔喀斯人大声惊叫起来，埃厄忒斯也惊得呆呆地望
着那块大石头。这块石头，四个人才能移得动，可伊阿宋一个人就搬了起来。

    地上冒出来的巨人开始像恶狗争食一样，互相厮打起来，他们怒吼着互相残
杀，杀得难分难解。他们拼杀达到白热化时，伊阿宋扑过去，拔出剑，左刺右杀，
把这批巨人全部砍倒。　　国王大怒，一言不发地转身离开，回到城里去了。他
只是想着，如何才能对付伊阿宋。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-15 ：美狄亚取得金羊毛

    施瓦布

    一整夜，国王埃厄忒斯和贵族在宫中商议，如何才能战胜阿耳戈英雄，因为
他知道白天发生的事情，都是在女儿的帮助下才得成功的。赫拉女神看到伊阿宋
面临的危险，因此使美狄亚的内心充满疑惧。美狄亚预感到父亲已经知道她提供
了援助，并且担心侍女们也知道了事情的底细。她想来想去，决定逃走。" 再见
了，亲爱的母亲。" 美狄亚流着泪，自言自语，" 再见了，卡尔契俄珀姐姐，再
见了，父亲的王宫！唉，外乡人啊，要是世界上根本就没有你，要是你还没来到
科尔喀斯就已葬身大海，那该多好啊！" 　　她如同一名逃犯似的，匆匆忙忙地
离开了她的家庭。她念着咒语，宫殿的大门自动打开了。她赤着脚穿过一条条窄
小的街道，她左手拉着面纱遮着脸，右手提住拖在地上的长袍，免得走路时受到
影响。城门的守卫没有认出她来。不一会，她来到城外，从小路上走到神殿。现
在她又向海岸走去，终于看到了阿耳戈英雄们为庆祝伊阿宋的胜利而通宵燃烧的
篝火。当她在河岸上走到靠近大船的地方时，便大声呼唤姐姐的小儿子弗隆蒂斯
的名字。在她第三次呼喊时，他听出了美狄亚的声音。英雄们先是吃了一惊，接
着把船摇到岸边。还没等船靠岸，伊阿宋一步跳上了岸。弗隆蒂斯和阿耳戈斯也
随后跟了上来。" 救救我吧！" 姑娘急切地叫道，" 一切都暴露了，现在已无法
可想。在我的父亲还未骑上快马追来之前，快让我们驾船逃跑吧！哦，我再帮你
们将金羊毛搞到手。我决定施用催眠术将恶龙送入梦乡。你们就可以乘机取走金
羊毛。不过你，外乡人啊，可得当着众英雄的面向神}发誓，当我孤身一人到了
你们那遥远的国土时，你保证维护我的尊严！" 　　伊阿宋心内一阵欢喜，轻轻
地把姑娘从地上扶起来，抱住她，说：" 亲爱的，让主宰婚姻的宙斯和赫拉作证，
我愿意把你当作我的合法妻子带回家乡！" 他发完誓把自己的手放在她的手中。

    于是，美狄亚吩咐英雄们连夜行动，把船摇到圣林去夺取金羊毛。伊阿宋和
美狄亚从另一条穿过草原的小路，走到圣林。他们看见那棵高大的栎树上张挂着
的金羊毛在黑夜中放光，对面不眠的恶龙毫无倦意地看守着。它一见来人，便伸
长着脖子，朝他们游来，发出一阵阵可怕而又尖利的吼叫，河岸和树林里响起一
阵阵沉闷而又凄凉的回声。美狄亚毫无畏惧地迎上去，她以一种甜美的声音祈求
神}中最有神奇威力的睡神斯拉芙，为她呼唤恶龙入睡。同时，又请求伟大的地
狱女神，赐福给她，帮助她实现自己的计划。伊阿宋看着这一切，心里非常害怕。
但这时毒龙已在美狄亚的魔幻般的催眠歌中昏昏欲睡，弓起的背垂了下来，盘旋
的身子也慢慢地伸展开来。只有那颗丑恶的脑袋还直立着，并张开巨口，好像要
吞食步步走近的两个人。美狄亚跳上一步，用杜松树枝把魔液洒在巨龙的眼睛里。

    一股异香直扑龙鼻使它昏迷。现在，它闭着嘴，伸直了身体，躺在树林里，
熟睡了。　　按照美狄亚的吩咐，在她用魔油涂抹巨龙头额的时候，伊阿宋连忙
从栎树上取下金羊毛。两个人迅速逃离阿瑞斯树林。伊阿宋把金羊毛扛在肩膀上，
这宝物从他的脖子一直垂到脚跟，闪着金光，把夜间的小路照得通明。随后他连
忙放下金羊毛把它卷起来，因为他担心恶人或神}看中这件宝物会把它抢走。

    天刚蒙蒙亮，他们上了船。同伴们围着两人问长问短，都想用手摸一摸金羊
毛。

    伊阿末却不答应，将它用一件新斗篷盖住。然后，他又给美狄亚在后舱铺了
一张舒服的床，并对朋友们说道：　　" 亲爱的朋友们，现在让我们返航，回到
家乡去！由于这位姑娘的帮助，我们终于完成了使命，立下了功绩。我要把她带
回家乡，娶她为我的合法妻子。一路上你们应该帮我好好照顾她，我相信事情还
没有了结，埃厄忒斯一定会带领人追上来阻挡我们的归路。所以让我们一半人划
桨，另一半人持矛执盾，准备迎敌，打退他的进攻。" 说完话，他挥剑砍断缆绳，
然后手持武器，站在美狄亚和舵手安克奥斯旁边。大船箭一般地朝着河流的出海
口驶去。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-16 ：阿耳戈英雄们带着美狄亚逃跑

    施瓦布

    此时，埃厄忒斯和所有的科尔喀斯人都知道了美狄亚的恋情，以及她的行为
和逃跑的事。他们拿着武器，在市场上集合，然后急急地赶往河边。埃厄忒斯乘
坐太阳神给他的四马战车，左手执着圆盾，右手擎着大火把，身旁插着粗大的长
矛。他的儿子阿布绪耳托斯亲自驾车。大队人马来到河流入海口时，阿耳戈船早
已驶进大海，只见一个小黑点在海浪中上下颠簸。国王放下盾牌和火把，高举双
手，对着天空，请宙斯和太阳神证明敌人对他所犯下的罪孽，然后愤怒地对他的
居民宣布：如果他们不能在海上或岸上捉住他的女儿美狄亚，那么他们全要砍头。

    科尔喀斯人吓得脸色发白，马上扬帆出海，直往前面的黑点追去。船队由阿
布绪耳托斯指挥，黑压压的一片，航行在海上，如同鸟群一样。　　阿耳戈船鼓
起船帆在海上顺风航行。在第三天清晨，船驶进哈律斯河，到达巴夫拉哥尼阿海
岸。

    在这里，按美狄亚的吩咐，他们献祭救了他们的赫卡忒女神。英雄们突然想
起年老的菲纽斯曾给他们作过预言，要他们回来的时候走另一条路，可是没有人
知道路在哪里。还是佛里克索斯的儿子阿耳戈斯有办法，他从祭司们的记载中知
道他们的船正向伊斯河进发，这河发源于遥远的律珀恩山，它的一条支流流入爱
奥尼亚海，另一条支流流入西西里海。正当他向大家说明的时候，天空中出现了
一条宽阔的长虹，给他们指明了方向，同时刮起一阵顺风。天空中的征兆一再显
示出来，他们毫不犹豫地向前航行，一直到了伊斯河注入爱奥尼亚海的河口。河
水稳稳地流动着，似乎在欢迎英雄们凯旋。　　科尔喀斯人没有停止追赶。他们
驾着轻舟，抢在英雄们的前头到达伊斯河的入海口，埋伏在各个岛屿和海湾里，
封锁了英雄们的归路。阿耳戈英雄们看到科尔喀斯士兵人多势众，急忙下船上岸，
躲在一个岛屿上。科尔喀斯人紧紧地追寻他们，一场短兵相接的遭遇战一触即发。

    被逼得走投无路的希腊人准备谈和。双方议定：阿耳戈英雄们可以带走国王
许诺过的金羊毛，但他们必须把国王的女儿美狄亚送到另一座岛屿的阿耳忒弥斯
的神庙中，等待当地国王的仲裁，判定她到底是回到父亲那里，还是随阿耳戈英
雄们前往希腊。听到这消息，美狄亚忧心忡忡，把她心爱的人拉到一旁，流着泪
说：" 伊阿宋，你怎么处置我呢？你难道忘了在困难时对我立下的庄严誓言吗？
我对你信任，才轻率地离开了故乡，离开了母亲。我由于对你痴心，才帮你取得
了金羊毛。为了你，我看轻了自己的名份。为了你，我像你的妻子一样随你到希
腊去，你应当保护我。千万别让我独自留下来！假如我不得不被判给我父亲，那
我的生命就完了；假如你离弃了我，那么有一天你在灾难中会无限地怀念我；金
羊毛也会像梦幻一样离开你，消失在地狱之王哈得斯的手里；我的复仇的灵魂将
要搅得你心神不定，驱使你离开故乡，就像我被你诱骗离开自己的故乡一样！"
她任凭感情的洪流尽兴地发泄，激动得快发狂了。伊阿宋望着她，受到良心的责
备，于是他解释说：" 你放心吧，亲爱的！我并没有认真对待这个条约。我们只
是为了你才找了一个缓兵之计，因为我们面临着一大群敌人。如果我们真的与他
们开战，就会悲惨地战死，那时你的处境会更加不幸。我明说了吧，实际上这个
条约只是一种策略，希望以此击败阿布绪耳托斯。" 　　听到他的话，美狄亚又
向他献上一条残忍的计策。" 我已经作了一次孽，惹出了一场祸，" 她说。" 现
在我不能回头了，因此也不怕继续作孽。我要帮你打败科尔喀斯人，我将引诱我
的弟弟，让他落到你的手里，你去准备丰盛的酒席。我再争取说服使者们都离开
他，让他单独和我在一起。这时你就可以乘机杀死他。" 　　英雄们给阿布绪耳
托斯设下了圈套，给他送去许多礼物，其中有一件是雷姆诺斯女王送给伊阿宋的
华丽的金袍。机敏的美狄亚告诉使者，让阿布绪耳托斯在深夜前往另一岛上，到
阿耳忒弥斯神庙里，她将在那里思量一个计谋，为他重新取回金羊毛，让他带回
去交给父亲。美狄亚撒谎说，她是身不由己，被佛里克索斯的儿子们用暴力抓住，
交给外乡人的。　　事情果然如她所希望的那样发生了。阿布绪耳托斯对美狄亚
庄严的誓言深信不疑。他在漆黑的深夜摇船来到这神圣的岛上，希望从姐姐那儿
获得制服外乡人的计谋。这时伊阿宋挥着寒光闪闪的宝剑从背后冲出来。美狄亚
急忙转过身子，拉上面纱遮住眼睛，她不忍看见弟弟被杀害的惨状。可怜的国王
的儿子像祭坛上的羔羊一样被伊阿宋一剑砍死。无所不察的复仇女神从她的秘密
往处，看到了这件恐怖的事，眼中流露出阴暗的目光。　　伊阿宋擦去手上的血
迹，掩埋了尸体。美狄亚举起火把，向阿耳戈英雄们发出信号。他们涌上阿耳忒
弥斯岛，如同猛兽进入羊群一样，扑向阿布绪耳托斯的随从，他们没有一个生还。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-17 ：阿耳戈英雄们在归途中

    施瓦布

    珀琉斯见事情成功，急忙劝大家赶快离开河口，免得其余的科尔喀斯人知道
内情后追来。后来，科尔喀斯人果然追上来，但赫拉在天上闪着可怕的闪电，他
们被镇住了，不敢再追。可是，他们没有抓住国王的女儿，又失掉了国王的儿子，
回去无法交待，因此，最后都留在河口的阿耳忒弥斯岛，并且定居下来。　　阿
耳戈英雄们经过了许多海湾和海岛，其中有阿特拉斯的女儿，即卡吕普索女王统
治的岛屿。他们相信已经看到远方耸立的故乡的山峰。可是赫拉由于畏惧被激怒
的宙斯的意图，于是在海上刮起了一阵大风，将船漂到荒凉的埃莱克特律斯岛。

    这时雅典娜镶在船上的占卜木板开口说道：" 宙斯的恼怒，你们是逃避不了，
所以只能在海上漂泊。" 这块木板又说：" 除非魔法女神喀耳刻给你们洗却了谋
杀阿布绪耳托斯的罪孽！卡斯托耳和波吕丢刻斯应该向神}祈祷，让他们在海上
指点一条路，让你们能够找到太阳神和珀耳塞的女儿，即喀耳刻。" 　　英雄们
听到这块神奇的木板说出如此可怕的话来，又惊奇又害怕。只有孪生兄弟卡斯托
耳和波吕丢刻斯勇敢地站起来，祈求不朽的神}帮助他们。但是船被刮到埃利达
努斯河口，那里正是太阳神的儿子法厄同在太阳车上被烧死坠海的地方。直到现
在水中还冒着热气和火花。法厄同的几个姐妹现在已变成高高的白杨树，耸立在
河岸上，在风中发出阵阵的叹息声。晶莹的泪珠犹如琥珀一般滴落在地上，一部
分被太阳晒干，一部分被潮水冲到埃利达努斯河里。英雄们虽然靠坚固的船摆脱
了危险，但是他们也失去了一切乐趣。白天，曾经收留烧焦的法厄同尸体的埃利
达努斯河上，飘来一阵阵恶臭，他们闻了直恶心。深夜，他们又清楚地听到赫利
阿得斯姐妹们的悲哭声，听到她们琥珀般的泪珠如油一样滴进海里。后来，他们
来到罗达诺斯河的入海口。这时幸亏赫拉突然出现，以清晰的神}的声音叫他们
赶快离开，否则他们驶入河内，必然毁灭。赫拉降黑雾罩住大船，他们不知白天
黑夜地航行，经过无数凯尔特人的部落，终于看见第勒尼安海岸了，随即平安地
到达喀耳刻的岛屿。　　他们在这里找到了魔法女神。她正伏在海边，用海水洗
头。

    她曾做了一个梦，梦见她的房间和整幢房子里血流成河，大火吞食着她用来
迷惑外乡人的魔药，可是她却用手掌掬起血水，浇灭了熊熊的火焰。恶梦使她惊
醒了，她跳下床，奔到河边，在这里又是洗衣服，又是洗头发，好像上面真的沾
了血迹似的。成群怪兽跟在她身后，就像牲口跟着牧人一样。　　阿耳戈英雄们
一见喀耳刻，就知道她是残暴的埃厄忒斯的妹妹，他们惊得心里发慌。女神摆脱
了黑夜梦景的恐惧后，很快镇静下来，转身回去，她呼唤那些怪兽，像抚摸狗似
地用手抚摸它们的毛。　　伊阿宋吩咐所有的人都留在船上。他和美狄亚上岸，
朝喀耳刻的宫殿走去。喀耳刻不知道两位外乡人的来意。她请两人坐下。美狄亚
低着头，以手蒙住脸，伊阿宋把杀害阿布绪尔托斯的宝剑插在地上，双手紧握剑
把，闭着眼睛，把下巴支在手上。喀耳刻这才明白，来人希望寻得帮助，他们由
于漂流的辛苦，由于请求恕罪，来向她求救的。出于对宙斯的敬畏，喀耳刻宰了
一只乳狗，向哀求者的保护神宙斯献祭，祈求宙斯允许她为他们洗刷罪过。她吩
咐女仆水泉女神那伊阿得斯把所有赎罪的祭品全部端出去，送入大海。自己则站
到炉旁，庄严焚烧祭供的圣饼，祈求复仇女神的息怒，恳请万神之父赦免犯有罪
孽的人。祭供完毕后，她在两个人的面前坐了下来，问他们家住哪里，从何而来，
为什么请求她保护。她问话的时候，又想起梦中鲜血淋漓的可怕景象。美狄亚抬
起头来回答。看到她的双眼，喀耳刻吃了一惊，因为美狄亚跟喀耳刻一样也有一
双金光闪闪的眼睛。凡太阳神的子孙，都有这样一双眼睛。喀耳刻要求她用家乡
的语言回答。美狄亚开始用科尔喀斯地方的语言叙述起来，讲到埃厄忒斯、阿耳
戈英雄以及她本人的命运，只是隐瞒了谋杀她的弟弟阿布绪尔托斯的事实。魔法
女神知道她没说出的这件事，但她心里却同情这位侄女。她说：" 可怜的孩子，
你未能正大光明地离开家乡，相反却犯下了巨大的罪孽。你的父亲一定会追到希
腊，为他被杀的儿子报仇。我不想惩罚你，因为你恳求保护，而且你还是我的侄
女。可是我也不能帮助你，你带那位外乡人赶快离开吧。不管他是什么人，我都
无法提供帮助。我既不能支持你的计划，也不能赞同你的逃跑！" 听到这话，美
狄亚心里很痛苦。她用面纱捂住脸伤心地哭起来。伊阿宋抓住她的手，牵着她走
出了喀耳刻的宫殿。　　赫拉对自己的保护人非常同情。她派女使伊里斯穿过彩
虹小道，找来大海女神忒提斯，请她保护船和阿耳戈的英雄们。伊阿宋和美狄亚
上了船，突然吹起了一股暖和的西风。英雄们高兴地扬帆启航，大船趁着风势慢
慢地驶入了大海。不一会，他们看到面前有一座美丽的岛屿。那是迷惑人的女妖
塞壬的住地。她们用美妙的歌声诱惑过往船只的水手，然后将他们葬身鱼腹。她
们一半像鸟，一半像女人，总是蹲在海岸上，张望远方。走近她们的人，谁也逃
脱不了她们媚眼的诱惑。现在，她们正对着阿耳戈英雄唱着动听的歌儿。英雄们
正在抛缆绳，准备靠岸。俄耳甫斯突然从座位上站起来，开始弹奏神奇般的古琴，
悠扬的琴声盖过了女妖的歌声。同时船后吹来一阵瑟瑟作响的南风，把女妖的歌
声吹到了九霄云外。只有一个英雄，那是来自雅典的忒勒翁的儿子波忒斯，他听
了女妖的甜美的歌声，实在抵制不了诱惑，便丢下船桨，跳入大海，去追逐那令
人销魂的歌声。要不是西西里岛的厄里克斯高山守护神阿佛洛狄忒及时发现，并
把他从水中拉上来，扔在岛屿的山脚下，他也许早就完蛋了！从此以后他就住在
那里。

    阿耳戈英雄们以为他已葬身鱼腹，十分伤心。　　英雄们继续前进，来到一
处海峡，他们在那里又面临新的危险。这儿一边是峻峭的西拉山岩，伸向海里的
陡岩，好像要把过往的船只撞得粉碎。另一边正是卡利布提斯大漩涡。海水急速
旋转，好像要把过往船只吞没。中间的海里有无数的险礁。过去这儿是火神赫淮
斯托斯的地下冶炼场，现在只有从海里冒出的浓烟，把天空染得一片漆黑。当阿
耳戈英雄来到这里时，海洋女仙们，海神涅柔斯的女儿，都赶来救助。珀琉斯的
妻子忒提斯亲自在船尾给他们掌舵。她们围着大船游泳，遇到漂浮的山岩靠近时，
她们抓起船，像球似地朝前传过去。于是阿耳戈船一会儿随着波浪被托到空中，
一会儿又随着波浪沉进浪底。赫淮斯托斯站在礁石顶，肩上扛着锤子，观赏着这
一幕幕惊心动魄的场景。赫拉从晨星闪烁的空中俯视着，她紧紧抓住雅典娜的手，
因为她看得不禁头晕眼花了。最后阿耳戈英雄冲破重重险阻，平安地进入了辽阔
的大海，并来到善良的淮阿喀亚人和他们虔诚的国王阿尔喀诺俄斯居住的岛上。

    施瓦布

    阿耳戈英雄们在岛上受到热情的接待，他们正想松弛一下，好好休息休息，
这时科尔喀斯人的船队又绕道而来，突然出现在海边，大批的人上了岸。他们要
求把美狄亚带回故乡，如果不答应，便要和希腊人决一死战。阿耳戈英雄们正想
迎战，善良的阿尔喀诺俄斯连忙止住他们。美狄亚抱住国王的妻子阿瑞忒的双膝
说：" 女君主，我恳求你，别让他们把我送回故乡去。我不是轻率出逃的，实在
是因为我畏惧父亲，才下决心跟伊阿宋出走的。他把我作为新妇带回家乡。请你
同情我，并愿神}保佑你长寿，多子多孙，并赋予你的城市不朽的荣誉。" 她又
向各位英雄跪下恳求。每一个英雄都磨拳擦掌，信誓旦旦地向她保证，即使国王
阿尔喀诺俄斯想把她交出去，他们也要把她救出来。　　深夜，国王跟他的妻子
商议如何处置这位从科尔喀斯逃来的姑娘。阿瑞忒为她求情，并对他说，英雄伊
阿宋愿意娶她为合法妻子。阿尔喀诺俄斯是一个好心肠的人，他听了非常感动。

    " 当然，为了这个姑娘我也愿意亲自拿起武器，把科尔喀斯人赶出海岛。"
他说，" 可是，我又担心这样会违反宙斯的以礼待人的神训。再说，得罪强大的
国王埃厄忒斯也不是明智之举，因为他虽然住得很远，但他仍然有足够的力量去
攻击希腊。所以，我的决定是这样的：如果她还是一位未婚的姑娘，那么应该把
她交给她的父亲去处置；如果她已是伊阿宋的妻子，那么我不能让她离开丈夫，
破坏他们的幸福，因为她已属于丈夫，而不是属于父亲。" 　　阿瑞忒听到国王
的决定，吃了一惊，她连夜派出一名使者，把消息传给伊阿宋，并劝他赶在黎明
前结婚。

    伊阿宋征求同伴们意见，大家都赞成这样做。他们选择一处圣洁的山洞，让
美狄亚成了伊阿宋的妻子和伴侣。　　第二天清晨，海岸和田野沐浴着阳光，淮
阿喀亚人聚集在城里的街道上，岛屿的另一端站着科尔喀亚人，他们手执武器，
随时准备开战。阿尔喀诺俄斯走出宫殿，手握金王杖来宣布对姑娘的裁决。他的
身后站着一批贵族和随从，妇女们也聚在一起想一睹希腊英雄的风采，还有不少
人从乡下赶来，因为赫拉把这消息传遍了四面八方。　　一切都准备好了，献祭
的供品的香气直飘天宇。阿耳戈英雄们等了很久。最后国王坐在宝座上，伊阿宋
走上前去，发誓埃厄忒斯国王的女儿美狄亚是他的合法妻子。阿尔喀诺俄斯听到
这话，又传参加婚礼的证人上来，他们作证此事确实。于是国王庄严地宣判，美
狄亚已是伊阿宋的妻子，因此不能把她交给科尔喀斯人。他答应保护阿耳戈英雄。
科尔喀斯人再反对也无效。国王声明，他们可以作为和平的居民，住在岛上，或
者驾船离开。科尔喀斯人要不回美狄亚，害怕埃厄忒斯国王会动怒杀了他们，因
此不敢再回去。他们选择了前一种做法，留在岛上。过了一个星期，阿耳戈英雄
们依依不舍地告别了国王阿尔喀诺俄斯。他们带着丰盛的礼物上了船，高高兴兴
地继续航行。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-19 ：阿耳戈英雄们的最后一次冒险

    施瓦布

    他们又经过了许多海岸和岛屿，现在故乡伯罗奔尼撒的海岸已隐隐可见。突
然，船遭到一阵狂暴的北风的袭击，在海上漂泊了九天九夜，飘过了利比亚海，
最后来到非洲的瑟堤斯海湾。这里满是稠密的大叶藻，浮着一层厚厚的泡沫，犹
如平静的沼泽地。周围是伸展的沙滩，沙滩上既没有野兽，也没有飞鸟。阿耳戈
船被潮水冲上了沙滩，船身牢牢地搁浅在沙滩上。他们大吃一惊，纷纷跳下船来。

    面前是无边无际的泥淖，空旷、荒凉得如同天空一样。没有泉水，没有道路，
没有牧舍，只有死一般的寂静。　　" 糟了，唉，这是什么地方？风浪把我们送
到哪里来了？" 同伴们纷纷抱怨，" 我们宁愿在浮岩中砸碎，或者在一件壮烈的
事业中牺牲！" 　　" 是啊！" 舵手安克奥斯说。" 潮水把我们搁浅在这里，却
不再接我们回去。这下，继续航行或尽快回家的希望都落空了。" 　　他们好像
在瘟疫流行的城里遇到传染的人一样，一筹莫展，只好眼睁睁地看着病魔肆虐，
等待着死神的降临。夜晚，他们饿着肚子和衣躺在沙地上，默默地等死。国王阿
尔喀诺俄斯作为赠礼送给美狄亚的几位姑娘也惊恐地围住女主人，连连叹息。如
果不是利比亚的保护者，三位半人半神的女仙怜悯他们，那么这些人真会悲惨地
死去！　　三个仙女全身披着山羊皮，在炎热的中午，来到伊阿宋身旁，轻轻揭
开他盖在头上的斗篷。伊阿宋惊惧地跳起来，虔诚而恭敬地注视着她们。" 不幸
的人啊，" 她们说，" 我们知道你们的苦难。可是你们不用再发愁了，当海洋女
神驾起波塞冬的马车时，你们感谢长久孕育你们的母亲吧。从此，你们就能顺利
地返回希腊。" 　　仙女们突然不见了，伊阿宋把这隐晦的、令人兴奋的神谕告
诉同伴们。正当他们苦苦思索时，又一个神奇的征兆出现了：一匹巨大的海马，
从海里跳上岸来，金黄的鬃毛披散在马背上，抖落了身上的水滴飞奔而去。珀琉
斯高兴地欢呼起来：" 谜语般的神谕中已有一半得到了解释。海洋女神已卸下了
马车，那车子正是这匹马拉的。长久孕育我们的母亲，便是阿耳戈船。为此我们
应该感谢她。让我们把船扛在肩上，走过这块泥地，顺着地上海马的足迹走去，
它一定会指引我们到达停泊的地方。" 　　说了就做。英雄们果然扛起大船，在
泥淖里走了整整十二天。到处都是荒凉的沙滩，要不是神}给了他们信心和力量，
他们也许早在第一天就死了。他们终于来到忒律托尼的海湾，大家疲倦地把船从
肩膀上放下来。由于干渴难忍，他们到处寻找水源。歌手俄耳甫斯在找水的途中
碰上夜神赫斯珀洛斯的四个女儿，她们都是善于唱歌的仙女，住在巨龙拉冬看守
金苹果的圣园。俄耳甫斯恳求她们给焦渴的人指示有泉水的地方。她们顿生同情
之心。其中最为仁慈的埃格勒，告诉她一件奇事。　　" 昨天，这里出现了一个
勇敢的强盗。" 她说，" 他杀掉巨龙，抢走了金苹果，他一定会帮助你们。他是
一个极野蛮的人，他一脸愤怒的表情，眼睛闪闪发亮，身上披着粗糙的狮子皮，
手中拿着橄榄棒和射死巨龙的弓箭。他也是从沙漠里出来的，因口渴难忍到处找
不到水源，便用脚朝一块岩壁踢了一脚。说来奇怪，岩壁如中了魔似的，隙缝中
顿时流出了清凉的泉水。这个巨人伏在地上，用双手捧着水喝，喝足后便躺在地
上休息。" 　　埃格勒说着把岩泉指给他看。英雄们全闻声赶来。清凉的山泉救
活了他们干枯的生命，大家又变得很高兴。" 真的，" 一个英雄说，一面用泉水
滋润一下炽热的嘴唇，" 那个人是赫拉克勒斯，他救了大家，但愿我们还能遇上
他！" 说完，他们分头到处去寻找。当他们垂头丧气地走回来时，都说没有看见
他，只有锐眼林扣斯说曾见到他一眼。不过他正在远处，要追他回来是不可能的。

    不幸得很，他们又发生了意外事件，丢失了两位同伴，大家都很悲伤。后来，
他们又上船航行。他们把船开出忒律托尼海湾，进入一望无际的大海，海面上刮
起了逆风，船受阻横在港口里。他们听从歌手俄耳甫斯的建议，上岸给当地的神
}献祭船上最大的三脚鼎。在回来的途中，他们遇到海神忒律托尼。他扮成少年
模样，从地上捡起一块泥土，交给阿耳戈英雄奥宇弗莫斯，表示尽地主之谊。奥
宇弗莫斯接过土块，将它藏在胸前。　　" 我父亲把这块海域赐给了我，" 海神
说，" 我成了当地的保护神。你们看，那里冒着黑水的地方，是海湾到大海的狭
窄通道。你们往那边划，我再给你们送上一阵顺风，使你们很快就会到达伯罗奔
尼撒。" 他们满心高兴地上了船。忒律托尼扛起了三脚鼎，又消失在海浪中。

    航行了几天后，阿耳戈英雄平安地来到了喀耳巴托斯岛。他们想从这里转向
克里特岛。但岛上的守护者是可怕的巨人塔洛斯，他是青铜时代的人类留下来的
人。

    宙斯让他把守欧罗巴，并吩咐他每天都迈开铜腿在岛上巡视三次。塔洛斯的
身体是青铜的，因此不会受伤，只有脚踝上有一块是肉，有着筋脉和血管。谁要
是知道这一点，把它打中，就能够杀死他。因为他毕竟是凡人，不是永生的。阿
耳戈英雄朝海岛驶来。塔洛斯正站在海边的礁石上，一看见外乡人来了，便抓起
石块朝船上掷去。英雄们吃了一惊，急忙摇桨往后躲避。为了逃脱危险，他们尽
管口渴难忍，还是准备放弃登陆计划。这时美狄亚站起身来，说：" 男子汉们，
你们听着：我知道怎样制服这怪物。把船靠过去，靠在石块掷不到的地方。" 说
完，她提起紫金袍，登上甲板，伊阿宋跟在她身旁。美狄亚小声地念着魔咒，三
度召唤命运女神，以及到处追逐生命的地狱猎狗。她又使用魔法使塔洛斯闭上眼
皮。

    恶梦侵入他的灵魂，在梦中他抬起肉脚，蹬在尖锐的石头上，伤口里流血如
注。

    他痛醒了，挣扎着想站起身来，可是却像一棵砍断一半后被大风吹倒的松树
一样摇晃着，突然大吼一声，栽进海里。　　阿耳戈英雄们平安地上了岸，他们
在岛上舒舒服服地休息到第二天清晨。可是，当他们刚刚离开克里特岛的时候，
又碰到新的可怕的危险。天空突然变得一片漆黑，没有月亮，没有星星。黑暗好
像从地狱里升腾起来，连接着天空。他们不知道现在是在海上，还是顺着波浪流
向塔耳塔洛斯。伊阿宋高举双手，祈求太阳神阿波罗把他们从可怕的黑暗里拯救
出来。

    太阳神听到了他的祈求，从奥林匹斯圣山上降下来，跳到大海里的一块岩石
上，手执金弓，射出一支锃亮的银箭。在闪亮中，他们看到前面有一座小岛。在
那里，他们抛锚停泊，等待着天明。当他们又在灿烂的阳光中航行在海上时，奥
宇弗莫斯讲起夜间做的怪梦：忒律托尼送给他的土块在胸间好像吃饱了奶，有了
生命，长成一个可爱的少女，她对他说：" 我是忒律托尼和利彼亚的女儿。把我
交给海神涅柔斯的女儿吧，让我在靠近阿娜弗的海上生活。然后我会重新在阳光
中生活，并赡养你的子孙。" 因为他们刚才停泊的岛叫阿娜弗，所以伊阿宋马上
明白了梦中的意思。他劝说朋友，把怀里的泥块扔进大海。奥宇弗莫斯照他说的
做了。啊，看哪！在英雄们的眼前，一个草木丰盛的岛屿长出了海面。他们称它
为卡里斯特，意即最漂亮的岛。后来，奥宇弗莫斯同他的子孙就住在岛上。　　
这便是阿耳戈英雄们最后的冒险。不久，他们就到了伊齐那岛，并从那里平安地
进入爱俄尔卡斯海湾。伊阿宋把阿耳戈船搁在科任托斯海峡上献祭给海神波塞冬。
天长日久，大船破成灰烬后，神}们把它安放在天上，它在南方的天空闪亮，成
了一颗亮晶晶的星星。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事19-20 ：伊阿宋的结局

    施瓦布

    伊阿宋还是没能得到爱俄尔卡斯的王位，尽管他为了王位历经危险的航程，
把美狄亚从她的父亲那里夺走，并残酷地杀害了她的弟弟阿布绪尔托斯。他不得
不把王国让给珀利阿斯的儿子阿卡斯托斯，自己带着年轻的妻子逃往科任托斯。

    在这里，他们住了十年，美狄亚给他生下三个儿子，前两个是双胞胎，名叫
忒萨罗斯和阿耳奇墨纳斯，第三个儿子叫蒂桑特洛斯，年龄尚小。在这段时间里，
美狄亚由于年轻美貌，品格高尚，举止得当，所以深得丈夫的宠爱和尊重。可是
后来她年龄大了，魅力日减，伊阿宋又迷上了科任托斯国王克雷翁的漂亮的女儿
格劳克。伊阿宋瞒着美狄亚向她求婚。国王答应了婚事，选下了结婚日期，直到
这时，他才打定主意，说服妻子美狄亚解除婚约。他发誓说，并不是他已经厌恶
她，而是为孩子们着想。他不得不和王室结亲。美狄亚一听，怒不可遏，大声地
呼唤诸神为他以前对她立下的誓言作证，但伊阿宋不顾这些，还是准备与国王的
女儿结婚。　　美狄亚绝望了，在丈夫的宫殿里急得团团转。" 天哪，苦命的我，
怎么能活下去？让死神怜悯我吧！呵，我的父亲，我的故乡，我可鄙地离开了你
们！

    啊，弟弟，我杀害了你，你的血现在朝我流来！但并不是我的丈夫伊阿宋应
该惩罚我，我是为了他才犯罪的，啊，正义女神，求你毁灭他，毁掉他那年轻的
情妇！

    " 　　她正在宫中怒气冲冲地徘徊时，伊阿宋的新岳父，国王克雷翁向她走
来。

    " 你竟仇恨你的丈夫！" 克雷翁说，" 立即带着你的儿子，离开我的国家。
不把你赶出我的国境，我决不回去。" 美狄亚压住怒火，平静地说：" 你为什么
怕我作恶呢，克雷翁？你没有对我干什么坏事，没有欠我的债。你看中了那个男
人，就把女儿嫁给了他，我为什么要怪你呢？我只是仇恨我丈夫。但木已成舟，
但愿他们像夫妻一样生活下去吧。只是让我还住在你的王国里吧，即使受了极大
的屈辱，我也会一声不吭，屈从强者对弱者安排的命运！" 　　克雷翁看到她的
眼里充满仇恨，不相信她的话。就在美狄亚抱住他的双膝，并以他的女儿格劳克
的名字发誓时，国王还是不敢相信她。" 走开！" 他说，" 别让我留下隐患！"
美狄亚无可奈何，请求他延缓一天，以便她为孩子们找一个去处。国王考虑了一
下说：" 我并不是一个无情的人。有许多次我由于怜悯和宽容，愚蠢地作了让步。
现在也是这样，我感到让你拖延一天，这样做并不聪明。可是，我还是让你这么
办吧。" 　　美狄亚得到了她所希望的延缓一天放逐，又变得狂妄起来。有个计
划她在脑子里想过，但还不敢采用，现在她决定把它加以实现。首先，她想作最
后一次努力，向她的丈夫指明过失，以便他回心转意。她走到他的面前，说："
你背叛了我，现在又找到了新妇，把自己的孩子都弃之不顾。假如你没有孩子，
我还可以原谅你，可现在我无法原谅你。你以为听你发誓忠于爱情的神}已不存
在了吗？你以为现在又有了新法律，你可以背弃誓言吗？现在，我把你当作朋友
一样问你，你要我到哪里去呢？难道你想把我送回父亲那里？那里是我为了你才
背弃了他，杀害了他的儿子的地方。你难道忘了吗？你还有什么地方可以让我安
身呢？假如你的前妻领着你的儿子像乞丐似的到处漂泊，你面子上有什么光彩？
" 伊阿宋无动于衷。他只答应给她和孩子们一笔金钱，并写信给各地的朋友们收
留她。美狄亚对这种救助不屑一顾。" 去你的，你在作践自己。" 她说，" 去结
婚吧，你的婚礼将是痛苦的！" 她离开后又对刚才说出的话感到后悔，并不是她
改变了主意，而是担心她的话会引起伊阿宋的怀疑。所以，她又请伊阿宋来商谈，
语气温和地对他说：" 伊阿宋，请原谅我刚才所说的话。我一时气愤说了伤感情
的话，我现在明白了，你的做法是为了我们的利益。我们流亡到这里，一无所有，
你想通过一场新的婚姻为你、为你的孩子，最终也为我谋求幸福。好吧，今后你
可以把孩子接回去，让他们跟继母的孩子们一起生活。我想，你们一定会生儿育
女的。孩子们，过来吧，来，吻一下你们的父亲，原谅他，就像我已经原谅了他
一样！" 　　伊阿宋真的以为她原谅了他，真是喜出望外，并给美狄亚和孩子们
作出了各种各样的保证。美狄亚以更甜蜜的语言让他相信她已不再怀恨他了。她
请求丈夫，把孩子留在宫殿里，让她一人离开。为了要得到国王和格劳克的同意，
她又从自己的储藏室里取出许多珍贵的金袍，交给伊阿宋送给新娘，作为礼物。
伊阿宋踌躇了一会，终于答应了。他派了一个仆人，将礼物送给新娘。

    但这些珍贵的衣袍上都是用浸透了魔药的料子缝制的。美狄亚假惺惺地和丈
夫告别之后，就时时刻刻地等待着新妇收下这些礼物的消息。有一位可靠的仆人
会把消息告诉她的。仆人终于气喘吁吁地奔了过来，在远处就嚷道：" 美狄亚，
快上船，快逃走！你的女仇人和她的父亲都已死去。你的儿子和伊阿宋走进新娘
房间时，我们这些仆人都很高兴，怨恨终于消除了。国王的女儿看到你的丈夫非
常开心，然而她看到孩子时，又用面纱蒙着眼睛，转过脸去，不想搭理孩子。伊
阿宋竭力安慰她，还为你说了不少好话，并把礼物拿给她看。国王的女儿看到美
丽的金袍时，满心欢喜，马上答应新郎提出的一切要求。当你的丈夫和儿子离开
后，她马上贪婪地看着这些美妙的衣袍，将斗篷披在身上，又把金色的花环套在
头上，喜不自胜地在镜子前上下打量。后来，她还高兴地在房间里走来走去，像
一个小姑娘似的为自己的新装而得意。可是，她欢乐的心情突然消失了，面色苍
白，四肢痉挛，摇摇晃晃地往后退着，还没有走到椅子跟前，扑的一声栽倒在地
上，翻着白眼，口中吐出白沫。大家都惊住了。仆人赶紧去找国王，另外几个仆
人赶紧去喊她的未婚夫。突然她戴在头上的花环喷出了火焰，火焰烤得她的皮肉
吱吱作响。当国王悲伤地赶到时，他只看见女儿的尸体已烧得变了形。在绝望中，
国王扑向女儿拥抱她，可是他中了女儿身上那件漂亮衣服上的剧毒，也死了。伊
阿宋的情况怎么样，我还不知道。" 仆人一口气说完这些情况，美狄亚听了，还
不解恨，复仇的怒火煽得更旺。她如同复仇女神一样，急忙奔出去，准备给她丈
夫和自己一个致命的打击。她首先来到儿子的卧室，这时天已晚了。" 我的心啊，
不要软。" 她自言自语地说，" 为什么在做这可怕却又十分必需的事情时要犹豫
呢？

    忘掉他们是你的孩子，忘掉你是生养他们的母亲，只要在这一瞬间忘记他们，
以后你可以为他们痛哭一辈子！你不杀死他们，他们也会死在仇人的手里。" 当
伊阿宋急忙赶回家中，要为年轻的新妇向美狄亚报仇时，他听到里面传来孩子们
的惨叫声。他奔到他们的住房里，看到他的儿子倒在血泊中，像献祭的供品一样
被杀害了。他在屋里找美狄亚，却没有找到。伊阿宋绝望地离开了自己的家，听
到空中传来阵阵声响。他抬头一看，看到了可怕的杀人凶手。她坐在用魔法召来
的龙车上，升上天空，离开了她用一切手段复仇的人间。伊阿宋无法惩罚她，陷
于绝望中，谋杀阿布绪尔托斯的场面又浮现在眼前。他没有其他选择，于是拔剑
自刎，死在他家的门槛上。

    施瓦布

    注：第二十章标题为《赫拉克勒斯的故事》。　　赫拉克勒斯是宙斯与阿尔
克墨涅所生的儿子，阿尔克墨涅是珀耳修斯的孙女，底比斯国王安菲特律翁的妻
子。安菲特律翁也是珀耳修斯的孙子，是泰林斯国王，但后来离开了那个城市，
移居底比斯。　　宙斯之妻赫拉痛恨阿尔克墨涅当了丈夫的情妇，当然，她对赫
拉克勒斯也很忌恨，因为宙斯向诸神预言，他的这位儿子前途无量，将来大有作
为。当阿尔克墨涅生下赫拉克勒斯时，她担心他在宫中安全没有保障，于是将他
放在篮里，篮子上盖了一点稻草，然后放到一个地方，这地方后来被称为赫拉克
勒斯田野。当然，如果不是一个神奇的机会，使雅典娜跟赫拉走到那地方，这孩
子肯定活不了。雅典娜看到孩子生得漂亮，非常喜欢。她很可怜他，便劝赫拉给
孩子喂奶。他咬住赫拉的奶头，贪婪地吮吸她的乳汁，吸得她的奶头生疼。赫拉
生气地把孩子扔到地上。雅典娜同情地把孩子抱起来，带回城里，交给王后阿尔
克墨涅代为抚养。阿尔克墨涅一眼就认出这是自己的儿子，她高兴地把孩子放进
摇篮。她由于畏惧赫拉，遗弃了孩子，没想到满怀妒嫉的继母竟用乳汁救活了她
情敌的儿子。不仅如此，赫拉克勒斯吮吸了赫拉的乳汁，从此脱离了凡胎。但赫
拉很快就明白那个吸她奶的孩子是谁，而且知道他现在又回到了宫殿。她十分后
悔当时没有报复孩子，把她除掉。随即她派出两条可怕的毒蛇，爬进宫殿去杀害
孩子。　　深夜，孩子沉浸在甜蜜的酣睡中。熟睡的女佣和母亲都没有发现两条
毒蛇从敞开的房门里游了进来。它们爬上孩子的摇篮，缠住孩子的脖子。孩子大
叫一声醒了过来。他抬起头，四面张望，只是感到脖子被缠得难受。这时他显示
了神的力量。两手各抓住一条蛇使劲一捏，竟把两条蛇捏死了。　　阿尔克墨涅
被孩子的叫声惊醒。她赤着脚，奔了过来，大喊救命，但她发现两条大蛇已死在
孩子手上。底比斯王室的贵族们听到呼救，都全副武装地涌进内室。国王安菲特
律翁疼爱孩子，把他看作宙斯赐予的礼物，这时他手持宝剑跑来。当他听到并看
到所发生的事情时，他又惊又喜，为儿子的神力而感到自豪。他把这件事看作一
个预兆，派人找来底比斯的盲人占卜者提瑞西阿斯。这位提瑞西阿斯是宙斯赋予
预言能力的人，他当着大家的面预言孩子的未来：他长大以后，将杀死陆上和海
里的许多怪物；他将战胜巨人，在他历尽艰险后，他将享有神}们的永久生命，
并赢得青春女神赫柏的爱情。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事20-2：赫拉克勒斯所受的教育

    施瓦布

    国王安菲特律翁从盲人占卜者的口中知道儿子天赋极高，他决心让儿子享受
配做一个英雄的教育。他聘请了各地英雄给年轻的赫拉克勒斯传授种种本领。他
亲自教他驾驶战车的本领；俄卡利亚国王欧律托斯教他拉弓射箭；哈耳珀律库斯
教他角斗和拳击；刻莫尔库斯教他弹琴唱歌。宙斯的双生子之一卡斯托耳教他全
副武装地在野外作战；阿波罗的儿子，白发苍苍的里诺斯教他读书识字。赫拉克
勒斯显示了学习的天赋和才能。可是他不能忍受折磨，而年老的里诺斯又是一个
缺乏耐心的教师。有一次，他无端责打赫拉克勒斯。赫拉克勒斯顺手抓起他的竖
琴，朝老师头上扔去，他即刻倒地身亡。赫拉克勒斯十分后悔，但他仍被传到法
庭。为人正直而又知识渊博的法官拉达曼提斯宣布他无罪。法官颁布了一条新法，
即由于自卫而打死人者无罪。可是安菲特律翁担心力大无穷的儿子以后还会犯下
类似的罪过，所以把他送到乡下去放牛。赫拉克勒斯在这里过了一年又一年，长
得又高又强壮。他身高一丈多，双眼炯炯有神，犹如闪烁的炭火。他善骑会射，
射箭或投枪都能百发百中。当他１８岁时，已长成希腊最英俊、最强壮的男子汉。

    他面临着命运的挑战，现在是看看他一身武艺和力量是用来造福还是作恶的
时候了。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事20-3：赫拉克勒斯选择生活道路

    施瓦布

    赫拉克勒斯离开了牧人和牛群，来到一块寂静的地方，思考他的人生道路到
底该怎样选择。突然，他看到两位高贵的妇女迎面走来。一位女子仪态万千，高
贵而纯洁，目光谦和，举止有礼，穿一身洁白的长袍。另一位雍容华贵，雪白的
肌肤抹了香粉和香水，姿态端正，使她显得比实际的要高一些。她的目光直视前
方，衣服穿得得体，显出无限魅力。她自我欣赏一番，又顾盼自如，看看有没有
人在仰慕地打量她。当她们走近时，后一位女子抢前几步，赶在第一位女子前面，
朝着英俊的赫拉克勒斯走过来，打着招呼说：" 赫拉克勒斯，我看得出，你还在
犹豫不决，不知选择怎样的生活道路。如果你选我做你的女友，那么我可以领你
走上一条最舒适的生活道路。到那里，你可以享尽生活乐趣，一生没有烦恼和不
平；你不用参加任何战争，不用操心买卖的事，只是享用美酒和佳肴，你睡在温
暖柔软的床上，衣来伸手，饭来张口，不用从事体力和脑力劳动；可以尽情享用
别人的劳动果实，享不尽荣华富贵，因为我给予我的朋友享用一切的权利。" 赫
拉克勒斯听了这诱人的话语，诧异地问她：" 美丽的女子，你究竟叫什么名字？
" 　　" 我的朋友们称我为幸福女神。" 她回答说，" 而那些想贬低我的人则叫
我是轻佻女郎。" 　　正在这时，另一位女子也来到前面。" 我到这里来找你，
亲爱的赫拉克勒斯。" 她说，" 我认识你的父亲，知道你的天赋和你所受的教育，
这一切都给我一种希望，如果你选择我指引给你的路，那么你将成就世上的一切
善事和大事。可是我不能保证你享受荣华富贵。我只是愿意告诉你，天上的神}
是多么喜欢你。但是，一切收获都不会从天上掉下来。你如果希望神}保护你，
那么你首先应该敬奉他们；你要得到朋友们的爱戴，那么就该为你的朋友做好事
；你要国家尊重你，你就应该为它服务；你要全希腊推崇你的美德，那么你就应
该为全希腊谋幸福；有播种才有收获，你想赢得战争，就得学会战争的艺术；你

断了她的话。" 你看，亲爱的赫拉克勒斯，" 她说，" 你要走多么漫长而崎岖的
道路，才能到达她所说的目标。而我却以最舒服的方式引导你走向幸福。

    ""你是个说谎的女人，" 美德女子对她说，" 你没有一点美的东西。你不知

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事20-4：赫拉克勒斯最初的英雄行为

    施瓦布

    两位女子说完话，顿时消失了，赫拉克勒斯独自一人留在原地，他决心选择
" 美德" 的路。不久，他找到了行善做好事的机会。众所周知，那时，希腊丛林
密布，沼泽遍野，到处是凶恶的猛狮、公猪以及其他作恶的野兽。因此，清除这
些孽障，把希腊从这类危害人的野兽中解放出来，乃是古代英雄们的伟大目标之
一。赫拉克勒斯注定面临这一艰巨的任务。当他听说，在基太隆山脚下，国王菲
特律翁的牧场，有一头可怕的狮子为非作歹时，年轻的英雄耳畔响起" 美德" 的
声音，他立即作出了决定，并全副武装，爬上了荒山，打死了狮子，剥下狮皮，
披在肩上，然后又把狮头割下来作头盔。　　当他打猎凯旋时，途中遇到了明叶
国王埃尔吉诺斯派出的使者，他们向底比斯人收取年贡，这是一种既不合理又令
人感到屈辱的沉重负担。赫拉克勒斯把自己作为一切受压迫的人的解救者，迅速
地把这些烂施淫威的使者们打翻在地，然后，把使者们捆起来，送回去给他们的
国王。埃尔吉诺斯蛮横地要求底比斯国王交出凶手。底比斯国王克瑞翁畏惧对方
的权势，准备满足对方的要求。赫拉克勒斯动员了一批勇敢的青年同他一起抵抗
敌人。可是，民间却没有一件武器，因为明叶人为防止底比斯人叛乱，收缴了所
有的武器。雅典娜女神看到这情况，便把赫拉克勒斯召进神庙，用自己的盔甲将
他武装起来，神庙里还有不少武器，那是他们的祖先在战争中缴获的武器，作为
战利品来献祭诸神的。随赫拉克勒斯一同前来的青年们纷纷拿起武器，跟着赫拉
克勒斯一起出征。他们只有一小队人马，而明叶人则是庞大的军团，兵力强大。

    两支部队在一处狭路相逢，在这块弹丸之地，明叶的士兵虽多，但根本无法
施展，埃尔吉诺斯的军队被彻底击溃，自己也战死沙场。可是，赫拉克勒斯的后
父安菲特律翁也在战争中中箭身亡。战争结束后，赫拉克勒斯迅速挺进明叶京城
奥耳科墨诺斯，他冲进城里烧毁了王宫，毁坏了城池。　　全希腊人都赞颂他的
丰功伟绩。　　底比斯国王克瑞翁为嘉奖他，把女儿墨伽拉许配给他，后来墨伽
拉为他生了三个儿子。诸神也送给这位半神半人的英雄许多礼物：赫耳墨斯送给
他一把剑，阿波罗送给他一把弓，赫淮斯托斯送给他金箭袋，雅典娜送给他崭新
的青铜盾。他的母亲阿尔克墨涅却改嫁了，嫁给了法官拉达曼堤斯。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事20-5：赫拉克勒斯与巨人的战斗

    施瓦布

    赫拉克勒斯受到诸神的珍贵馈赠，心中感激不尽。不久，他找到报答机会。

    原来大地女神该亚为天神乌拉诺斯生下一群巨人，这些怪物面目狰狞，杂乱
的长须，长发，身后拖着一条带鳞的龙尾巴，这就成了他们的脚。母亲唆使他们
反对宙斯，因为宙斯成了世界的新主宰，把该亚从前生下的一群儿子，即提坦巨
人们全都打入了地狱塔耳塔洛斯。几年后，他们冲破了地狱，在帖撒利的田野上
冒出来。一看到他们，星星变色，连阿波罗都掉转了太阳车的方向。　　" 去吧，
孩子们，为我，为往昔的神}之子去报仇。" 大地之母对他们说，" 秃鹰在啄食
普罗米修斯的肝脏；提堤俄斯也受到惩罚，宙斯用闪电击中了他，他躺在地上，
两只大雕在啄他的肝脏！阿特拉斯被判处肩扛苍天；提坦巨人被铁链锁住受尽折
磨，去吧，去报仇，去拯救他们！你们应该用我的肢体――高高的山峰作为阶梯
和武器！登上星光照耀的城堡！阿耳克尤纳宇斯，你去夺下暴君手中的权杖和闪
电！

    恩刻拉多斯，你去征服海洋，将波塞冬赶走！律杜斯去夺下太阳神手里的缰
绳，珀耳菲里翁去占领特尔斐的神殿！" 巨人们听到命令，大声欢呼，好像已经
取得了胜利似的。他们纷纷登上了帖撒利山，准备从那里向天空发起冲击。　　
同时，神}的使者彩虹女神伊里斯，连忙召集诸位天神、水神以及地府里的命运
女神，让他们一起前来，共同商量对付的办法。冥后珀耳塞福涅离开了她的冥府
；她的丈夫，即沉默的死者的国王也骑着畏光的骏马爬上金光闪闪的奥林匹斯圣
山。如同一座被包围的城市的居民们从四面八方涌来卫城一样，神}们集合在奥
林匹斯圣山上。　　" 诸位神}，" 宙斯对他们说，" 你们看看，大地之母如何
起劲并又恶毒地反对我们。大家起来进行战斗吧！她给我们派来多少个儿子，我
们就要给她送回多少具尸体！" 　　当万神之父刚把话讲完，天空中就响起阵阵
雷鸣。

    地下的该亚在下面掀起猛烈的地震，作为回报。大自然又像造物时一样陷于
一片混乱。巨人们拔掉一座又一座高山，使帖撒利的俄萨山、佩利翁山、俄塔山、
阿托斯山全部堆砌起来，然后，用赫贝罗斯的一半源泉冲走罗杜泼山。巨人们以
山作梯一步步地朝着神}的住地爬上去，手里拿着燃烧的栎木大棒和巨大的石块，
像风暴一样向奥林匹斯冲击。神}们得到一则神谕，如果没有一名凡人参与战斗，
那么神}们就杀不死前来侵犯的巨人。该亚听到这消息，急忙寻找一种方法，以
保证自己的儿子们不受凡人的伤害。这需要一种药草。然而，宙斯却抢先一步，
他不让朝霞、月亮和太阳露出光芒。当该亚在黑暗中到处寻找药草时，宙斯却把
药草收割起来。他请雅典娜将药草交给自己的儿子赫拉克勒斯，并要求他前来参
战。　　奥林匹林斯圣山上燃起熊熊的战火。战神阿瑞斯端端正正地坐在战车上，
车前的骏马高声嘶鸣。他驾着马车朝着密集的敌人冲了过去。阿瑞斯手执闪闪发
光的金盾，照耀得比火焰还要明亮。他的战盔上的羽毛在风中呼呼作响。他一枪
刺穿了蛇足巨人珀洛罗斯，又驾着战车碾过他的肢体。但直到这巨人看到凡人赫
拉克勒斯爬到奥林匹斯山顶时，他才灵魂出窍而死。赫拉克勒斯环顾战场，为自
己的弓箭找到了目标：他一箭射中阿耳克尤纳宇斯，巨人滚落下去，可是接触到
大地，他又复活了。按照雅典娜的主意，赫拉克勒斯也追了下去。他把阿耳克尤
纳宇斯从地上举起。可怜的阿耳克尤纳宇斯一离开大地就死去了。　　这时，巨
人珀耳菲里翁气势汹汹地朝赫拉克勒斯和赫拉猛扑过来，要跟他们决一死战。宙
斯看着这一切，马上让巨人产生要看一看神后的念头，他刚掀开赫拉的面纱，宙
斯用炸雷击中了他。赫拉克勒斯射出一箭，使他当场毙命。巨人的战斗行列里已
奔出了眼中直喷火花的埃菲阿耳斯。　　" 来得正是时候，他已经成为我们射箭
的靶子。" 赫拉克勒斯大笑着对身旁的阿波罗说。于是，阿波罗和这位半神一起
动手，射出两箭，射中了埃菲阿耳斯的双眼。酒神狄俄尼索斯举起酒神杖，将律
杜斯打倒在地。赫淮斯托斯单手扔出一把烧得通红的铁弹。灼热的铁弹像暴雨似
的浇下，巨人刻吕提俄斯当场倒地身亡。雅典娜则举起西西里岛，猛地朝正在逃
跑的恩刻拉杜斯砸去，把他压住了。巨人波吕波特斯被波塞冬在大海上追击，一
直逃到爱琴海的可斯岛。波塞冬即刻劈裂海岛的一角，将他埋在里面。赫耳墨斯
头上戴着地狱神普路同的战盔，杀死了希波吕托斯。另外两位巨人也被命运女神
的铁棒砸死。　　其余的巨人被用雷电击溃或被赫拉克勒斯用弓箭射死。

    战斗结束，诸神称赞赫拉克勒斯的赫赫战绩。宙斯把参战的神}称作奥林匹
斯人，这是勇敢者的称号。凡间女子为宙斯所生的两个儿子，即狄俄尼索斯和赫
拉克勒斯，也获得了这光荣的称号。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事20-6：赫拉克勒斯与欧律斯透斯

    施瓦布

    在赫拉克勒斯出世之前，宙斯曾经在神}会议上宣布，让珀耳修斯的第一个
孙子主宰所有其他的珀耳修斯的子孙。他是想把这份荣誉给他和阿尔克墨涅所生
的一个儿子。可是赫拉十分嫉妒这种光荣归于自己情敌的儿子，于是她施展诡计，
让珀耳修斯的另一位孙子欧律斯透斯提前出世，本来他要比赫拉克勒斯晚出世。

    因此，欧律斯透斯成了迈肯尼的国王，后来出生的赫拉克勒斯成了他的臣民。
国王注意到他的那位年轻的兄弟声名显赫，于是如同召见臣民一样把他召来，给
他布置了一大堆困难的任务。赫拉克勒斯又不愿服从。但宙斯又不愿意违背自己
的规定，于是命令儿子执行国王的命令。这半神半人的英雄不甘当凡人的奴仆，
便离开家来到特尔斐，请求神谕。神谕昭示说：欧律斯透斯由于赫拉的诡计骗取
了王位，诸神将予以纠正，但赫拉克勒斯必须完成国王交给的十项任务。等到这
些任务完成以后，他就可以升格为神。　　赫拉克勒斯听到这神谕，心头郁闷，
深深地陷入悲哀之中。替一个比他低微的人服务，实在有损他的尊严，降低了自
己的身份。可是他又不敢违抗父亲宙斯的旨意。赫拉仍然妒恨赫拉克勒斯，虽然
他在与巨人作战中援助过神}们。她乘机让赫拉克勒斯的心头的郁闷变为野性的
狂暴。赫拉克勒斯控制不了自己，他甚至想要杀害他所珍爱的侄儿伊俄拉俄斯。
这位侄儿吃了一惊，连忙逃走。赫拉克勒斯在狂暴中用箭射死了他和墨伽拉所生
的孩子们，并想象他是用箭射杀巨人。他疯狂了很久才解脱出来。他看到自己闯
下了大祸，陷入更深的悲哀和不幸之中。他闭门不出，不见任何人。随着时光的
流逝，他心头的痛苦才有所减轻。他重新振作起来，决心去完成欧律斯透斯交给
的任务。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事20-7：勇斗尼密阿巨狮

    施瓦布

    国王交给赫拉克勒斯的第一件任务是：赫拉克勒斯必须为他剥下尼密阿巨狮
的兽皮。这头巨兽生活在阿耳戈利斯地区的伯罗奔尼撒，尼密阿和克雷渥纳之间
的大森林里。狮子凶悍无比，人间的武器根本不能伤害它。有人说，狮子本是巨
人堤丰和半人半蛇的女怪厄喀德那所生的儿子，还有人说，它是从月亮上掉到地
上来的。赫拉克勒斯出发去捕杀狮子。他一路奔波，来到克雷渥纳，遇见一位可
怜的短工，名叫莫洛耳库斯，受到了热情的接待。莫洛耳库斯正想宰杀一头牲口
献祭宙斯。" 善良的人哪，" 赫拉克勒斯说，" 让你的牲口再活三十天吧！如果
那时我能顺利地打猎回来，那么你就可以给救星宙斯献祭，如果我死了，你就应
当给我献祭，把我当作升入神}的英雄。" 　　说完，赫拉克勒斯又继续前进。

    他背着箭袋，一只手拿弓，另一只手上拿着从赫利孔山上连根拔起的橄榄树
做成的木棒。走了几天后，他来到尼密阿的大森林里。他在林间四下寻找，想在
狮子看见他之前，先发现它。可是周围看不到狮子的足迹，他没有遇到一个人。
所有的人由于害怕都躲在家里，关上门。傍晚，狮子才在一条林中小路上慢慢走
来。

    它刚刚捕食回来，准备回窝休息。它已吃得肚子鼓鼓的，头上、鬣毛和胸脯
上还滴着点点鲜血，舌头舔着嘴唇上的血。赫拉克勒斯看到它一步步靠近，连忙
躲进茂密的树丛里，悄悄地等它走近，并用箭头瞄准它的腰部，赫拉克勒斯拉开
弓射去一箭。可是他的箭没有射伤它，却像射在石头上一样被反弹回来，落在满
是苔藓的地上。狮子昂起浴血的头，转动着眼睛四下张望，露出可怕的巨牙。现
在，它正好把胸脯对着赫拉克勒斯。这位半神半人的英雄抓住时机，朝它的心脏
处射去第二支箭。可是这次也一样，箭伤不了它。赫拉克勒斯要射第三支箭时，
狮子已经看到了他。它暴怒地夹起长尾巴，脖颈因狂暴而膨胀，鬣毛竖起，弓起
背，瞪着血红的大眼，发出沉闷的吼叫，向它的敌人扑来。　　赫拉克勒斯扔下
手中的箭，丢掉披在身上的狮皮，右手挥着木棒朝狮子头狠狠打去，击中它的脖
子，狮子倒在地上。随即它跳起来，但扑了个空。然后它四肢颤抖着站起来，赫
拉克勒斯还没有等它恢复过来，立即冲上去。他干脆把身上背的弓箭全扔在地上，
腾出双手，抱住狮子的脖子，狠命地卡住狮子的喉咙，狮子挣扎了一阵，终于断
了气。赫拉克勒斯费尽周折也没有把狮皮剥下来，因为任何铁器都无法在它身上
划出一道口子。最后，他想出一个办法，用它的利爪划破了皮，终于把狮皮剥了
下来。后来，他用这张奇异的狮皮缝制了一件盔甲，还做了一只新头盔。现在，
他把带来的狮皮和武器收拾好，把尼密阿巨狮的狮皮披在肩上，出发回泰林斯去。

    赫拉克勒斯按照约定来到莫洛耳库斯那儿时，正好过去了３０天。莫洛耳库
斯忙着给赫拉克勒斯的亡灵献祭，然而，这位英雄突然出现在他的面前，他不禁
惊喜交加。于是两人一起给救世主宙斯献祭供品，而后，赫拉克勒斯亲切地同他
告别，往故乡走去。　　当国王欧律斯透斯看见赫拉克勒斯披着可怕的狮皮回来
时，吓得双腿发颤，他畏惧英雄的神力，从此，再也不让赫拉克勒斯走近自己，
各项命令都由珀罗普斯的儿子库泼洛宇斯为他转达。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事20-8：杀死九头蛇许德拉

    施瓦布

    国王交给赫拉克勒斯的第二件任务是杀死九头蛇许德拉。许德拉是堤丰和厄
喀德那所生的女儿。她是在阿耳哥利斯的勒那沼泽地里长大的，常常爬到岸上，
糟蹋庄稼，危害牲畜。她凶猛异常，身躯硕大无比，是个九头的蛇怪，其中八个
头可以杀死，而第九个头，即中间直立的一个却是杀不死的。　　赫拉克勒斯勇
气十足地去冒险。他驱车前往，为他驾车的是他的侄儿伊俄拉俄斯，即他的堂兄
弟伊菲克勒斯的儿子。伊俄拉俄斯一直伴随着他，是他不可分离的左右手。车子
急匆匆地朝勒那驶去。到了阿密玛纳泉水附近的山坡时，他们看到许德拉蛇怪正
在洞内。伊俄拉俄斯急忙拉住马缰绳，赫拉克勒斯跳下马车。他一连射了几箭，
把九头蛇许德拉蛇妖引出了洞。许德拉咝咝地嘘着气冲到赫拉克勒斯的面前，咄
咄逼人地昂着九个头，样子十分可怕。赫拉克勒斯无所畏惧地迎上去，用力一把
抓住她，卡得紧紧的。但她却猛地缠住赫拉克勒斯一只脚。赫拉克勒斯举起木棒
使劲打她的头，但是打碎了一个，马上又长出一个来。她的一只巨蟹跑来参战，
帮助许德拉。它用巨钳咬住赫拉克勒斯的脚。赫拉克勒斯怒不可遏地挥棒将它打
死，同时，呼喊伊俄拉俄斯来援助他。伊俄拉俄斯执着火把，把附近的树林点着，
然后用熊熊燃烧的树枝灼烧刚长出来的蛇头，不让它长大。这时，赫拉克勒斯乘
机砍下许德拉的那颗不死的头，将它埋在路旁，上面压着一块沉重的石头。接着，
他又把蛇身劈作两段，并把箭浸泡在有毒的蛇血里。从此以后，中了他箭的敌人
再也无药可医。

    施瓦布

    欧律斯透斯给他的第三个任务是要他生擒刻律涅亚山上的牝鹿。这是一头漂
亮的动物，金角铜蹄，自由自在地住在亚加狄亚的山坡上，这是女神阿耳忒弥斯
在首次打猎时捉到的五头牝鹿之一，只有她被放回树林，因为命运女神规定有一
天让赫拉克勒斯为追捕她而累得疲惫不堪。赫拉克勒斯追捕她追了整整一年，一
直追到北极净土族人居住的地方和伊斯忒河的发源地。据说，这里的太阳一年只
出来一次。赫拉克勒斯终于在安诺埃城附近，邻近阿耳忒弥斯山的拉同河岸上，
追上了牝鹿。为了迫使她停下来，他迫不得已射了一箭，射中她的腿。然后把受
伤不能奔跑的牝鹿逮住，扛在肩膀上，往回走。途中，他遇到女神阿耳忒弥斯和
她的哥哥阿波罗。她责问他为什么伤害她放生的牝鹿，甚至想夺走她的猎物。

    " 伟大的女神，这不是我在闹着玩，" 赫拉克勒斯辩解说，" 我也是迫于无
奈，否则我怎么能完成欧律斯透斯交给我的任务呢？" 　　这话总算平息了女神
的怒火。赫拉克勒斯扛着活牝鹿回到迈肯尼。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事20-10 ：活捉厄律曼托斯山上的野猪

    施瓦布

    赫拉克勒斯又接到第四个任务：活捉厄律曼托斯野猪，把它完好地带回迈肯
尼，交给国王欧律斯透斯。这头野猪是用来献祭给女神阿耳忒弥斯的圣物，可是
它在厄律曼托斯一带糟蹋庄稼，危害甚大。　　赫拉克勒斯在前往厄律曼托斯的
途中，来到西勒诺斯的儿子福罗斯的家中，半人半马的福罗斯是肯陶洛斯人，他
热情地端出一盆烤肉招待客人，自己则吃生的。赫拉克勒斯希望用美酒伴佳肴，
福罗斯听后笑着说：" 尊贵的客人，在我的地下室里有一桶酒，它属于我们全体
肯陶洛斯人。我不敢把它打开，因为我知道我们半人半马的肯陶洛斯人并不慷慨。

    ""打开吧，" 赫拉克勒斯说，" 我答应你，保护你不受他们的攻击。我现在
真是口渴难忍！" 　　原来，这桶酒是酒神巴克科斯亲自送给一个马人，即肯陶
洛斯人的，并吩咐他不能提前打开，直到第四代马人后，赫拉克勒斯到来时才能
打开。

    于是，福罗斯走到地下室。他刚把酒桶打开，马人们闻到一股扑鼻的酒香，
都蜂拥而来，手拿石块或木棒，把福罗斯的地下室团团围住。赫拉克勒斯拿起火
棒把第一批肯陶洛斯人打回去，又射箭追击余下的人，一直追到伯罗奔尼撒半岛
东南角的玛勒河，那是赫拉克勒斯的老朋友喀戎居住的地方。肯陶洛斯人纷纷投
奔喀戎。赫拉克勒斯朝他们射去一箭，箭头擦过一个肯陶洛斯人的手臂，射中喀
戎的膝盖，这时他才发现他射中了幼时的好朋友。他从朋友的膝盖上拔下箭，然
后又用精通医道的喀戎自己调制的药膏敷在伤口上。但因为箭已浸过许德拉的毒
血，伤口是无法医治的。喀戎吩咐他的弟兄把他抬回洞穴，希望能够死在朋友的
怀里。

    可惜这个愿望也是空妄的，因为他忘掉自己是不死的，他的伤痛也将永远忍
受。

    赫拉克勒斯含泪告别了喀戎，答应不管花多大的代价，也要请死神满足老朋
友的愿望，让他解脱痛苦。我们知道，他实现了自己的诺言。　　赫拉克勒斯重
新回到福罗斯那里，他看到这位朋友已经死了。原来他从一个肯陶洛斯死者的身
上拔出一支箭，不禁惊叹这支短箭竟有如此大的力量，能杀死一条生命。他顺手
把箭丢到地上，不料箭划破了自己的脚，他即刻毙命。赫拉克勒斯十分悲伤，将
朋友葬在一座山下，这座山从此就叫做福罗山。　　赫拉克勒斯继续上路去寻找
野猪。

    他大声吼叫，把野猪赶出丛林，又在后面追赶，一直把它赶到雪地里，终于
用活结把精疲力尽的野猪套住。他遵照国王欧律斯透斯的命令活捉了厄律曼托斯
山上的野猪，将它活生生地送到迈肯尼。

    [ 中文版] 古希腊神话故事20-11 ：清扫奥革阿斯的牛棚

    施瓦布

    国王欧律斯透斯下达了第五项任务。派他做的这件事似乎是一位英雄不屑干
的，即要他在一天之内把奥革阿斯的牛棚打扫干净。奥革阿斯是伊利斯的国王，
养有大量的牛。他的牛群全都按古代的习惯，关在宫殿前面的牛棚里，里面共有
三千多头牛。多年来里面堆满了牛粪。赫拉克勒斯不知道该如何行事，才能在短
短的一天内把牛粪清除干净。　　赫拉克勒斯来到国王奥革阿斯面前，愿意给他
清扫牛棚，但他没有说这是欧律斯透斯交给他的任务。奥革阿斯打量着眼前这位
身披狮皮的魁梧的男子，想到这样一位高贵的武士愿意干一件仆人干的活，禁不
住笑了起来。但他又想，私欲诱人，说不定这位武士贪图厚利，要我给他重赏吧。

    假如他真能在一天之内把牛棚打扫干净，我给他重赏也无妨，可是，这么多
牛粪怎能在一天内打扫干净呢？这件事无论什么人都不可能做到。国王想到这儿，
自信地说：" 听着，外乡人，假如你真能在一天之内，把宫殿前面的牛棚打扫干
净，我将把牛群的十分之一送给你。" 　　赫拉克勒斯接受了这个条件。国王以
为他马上就要动手清扫，但赫拉克勒斯却叫来奥革阿斯的儿子菲洛宇斯，叫他作
证人，然后才在牛棚的一边挖了一条沟，把阿尔弗俄斯和佩纳俄斯河的河水引进
来，流经牛棚，把里面大堆牛粪冲刷干净。　　结果，他连手都没有弄脏，就完
成了任务。　　奥革阿斯这时听说赫拉克勒斯是奉欧律斯透斯之命来做这件事的，
便想赖帐，否认他作过诺言，不给赫拉克勒斯任何报酬，还说，赫拉克勒斯如不
服，他们可以对簿公堂。当法官审理时，奥革阿斯的儿子菲洛宇斯出庭作证，宣
称那是真的，他的父亲答应给赫拉克勒斯重赏。奥革阿斯大怒，没等作出判决，
便命令他的儿子和外乡人立即离开他的王国。

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布（Gustav　Schwab，１７９２- １８５０）是德国著名的
浪漫主义诗人。他生于符腾堡宫廷官员家庭。曾任席勒的老师。１８０９- １８
１４年在蒂宾根大学攻读神学和哲学，结识乌兰德等著名文学家。１８１５年去
德国北部地区考察旅行，结识歌德和霍夫曼等人。他在文学上的主要贡献在于发
掘和整理古代文化遗产，曾出版《美好的故事和传说集》、《德国民间话本》和
《希腊神话故事》。他的主要诗集有《博登湖上的骑士》、《马尔巴赫的巨人》
等。　　《希腊神话故事》为读者敞开了一扇观察和认识古希腊乃至欧洲文化的
窗口。作为反映古希腊神}和英雄故事的《希腊神话故事》的确给人类的文化生
活留下了丰富的精神遗产。　　古代" 希腊七贤" 之一的哲学家泰利斯。封。弥
勒特曾经说过：" 神充斥一切！" 他指出，古代的希腊人几乎都认为世界是神}
创造并由神}统治的。尽管哲学家们把神}从形象到内含都解释得十分抽象，可
是这一切并不影响人们对神}的信仰，因为对希腊人说来，没有神}的世界那是
不可理喻的。认为神}就在身旁的意识逐步发展，最后成为希腊宗教。当然，希
腊宗教并不是社会生活的特殊领域，它不仅作用于某一些时刻或者某一些隆重的
场合，而且还具备穿透一切的力量。从这层意义上讲，希腊宗教成为孕育希腊文
化的母体。　　美籍物理学家贝特（１９０６- ）在分析欧美社会的生命现象时
指出：" 对一个具体的个人说来，生命从诞生到死亡，从清晨到夜晚，从家庭到
社会，始终穿戴着宗教的外衣。没有一幢房子里没有祭奉神}的场所，没有一天，
没有一餐膳食，没有一场音乐会，没有一次集会不带祭祀，不带对神}的问候。

    人们遇到每一件活动，信奉每一次欢乐，遭遇每一场烦恼，无论是幸福的欢
呼或是痛苦的颤抖时都会感到神}就在身前脚后，都会渴望地呼唤他们。一切艺
术、建筑、绘画、造型、诗歌、音乐和舞蹈都围绕并且服务于宗教，应宗教的需
要而发展，连运动员和养马人的体育比赛也是为了表彰神}和英雄而举办的。"
看来，古希腊人生活在一个虔诚的时代。人们无论把自己的眼光投向何方，在人
类活动的一切领域内，他们都可看出人类是跟神}的作用密切相联的。甚至钱币
也铸印神}的外貌和象征，从而显示其价值和神圣。　　尽管希腊人在他们的宗
教仪式中表现出许多区别，可是宗教始终是他们最强有力的凝聚力。宗教文化久
盛不衰，虔诚的宗教心理几乎成为创造社会文化的源泉。　　自然，信仰应该是
任何宗教的起源和核心。跟基督教相比较，希腊人的信仰并不建立在上帝的启示
以及显明的教义上，它没有必须履行义务的教条。相反，希腊宗教来源于坚定不
移的信仰，信仰神}是确实存在的。他们认为在生活中到处可以体验神的威力。

    当然，在人们的意识观念里表现神}存在的形式是各不相同的。而且，在不
同的时代，人们对神的认识和理解也不相同。古希腊人坚定地认为神是与世共存
的。

    他们直到很久以后才慢慢地达成共识，把抬头可见、伸手却不可即的天空让
给神}. 从此，神}不再跟陆地上的凡人混迹其中，他们各自占有活动的领域，
形成了神}和凡人的天地之别。　　考究神话的原意，其实就是" 话" 、" 故事
" 、" 消息".在希腊人广泛的语言习惯里，神话很快就区别于" 逻各斯" ，它意
味着臆造的传说或寓言，而" 逻各斯" 则表示经史实证明了的故事，或者指哲学
见解。

    因此，逻各斯排除了一切传说和寓言的成分。在希腊人的信仰领域里，神话
意味着神}般英雄的传说和故事，是他们的形象信息。必须说明，这里的形象并
不是外表的图象，而是神}们的气质形象。因此，神话作为古希腊民族精神的产
品，它对希腊人意味着一种高层次的真实表现，这类真实是无法核定的。后来，
在欧洲启蒙运动时期，欧洲人常把神话看作世人的臆造，可是希腊人却坚持认为
神话是神}客观存在的标志。　　神话在千百年的历史长河里强化了神}客观存
在的普遍认识。在神话世界中，神}都以类似凡人的体态与人类相处，他们其实
也被理解为人。因此，神话以及神话中塑造的神}形象给人类的精神生活添加了
巨大的影响。　　如同神话一样，宗教崇拜也是从信仰神}的意识中产生的，它
们两者都牵涉到信仰的原始现象。人们试图在宗教崇拜中寻找一种可能的机会，
以便用隆重的仪式把自己和神}连接一道。宗教崇拜反映在祈祷或者其他一些表
现形式上，它们可由人单独或私自进行，也可由团体或者集体进行。希腊人成功
地从早期巫术风俗中寻得了宗教崇拜的途径，而希腊的政治家们却把它们统一成
为对于神}的崇拜。　　神}究竟是什么呢？他们就是脱离死亡的人。神}是相
对于凡人而存在的，死亡是区别神}和凡人的分界线，而凡人就是不能脱离死亡
的人。

    神}是永恒的，他们在神话中跟凡人同样的出生，所以他们跟凡人生活在同
一个世界上。不过，神}比凡人显得强大和幸福。凡人由此而对神}表示尊重和
畏惧，可是他们在神}面前却并不感到自卑。　　神}的表现形式是多种多样的。

    一切生活着的，或者表现生命作用的都可成为" 神}".神}表现为各种植物、
动物、岩石或者人。希腊宗教是主张多神论的，因此希腊人讲到的神}往往就是
主管某一具体领域的精神总概念，这是区别于各种单神教的主要内容。　　在希
腊诗人希西阿（约公元前７００年）生活时期已经出现了明显的神}体系。宙斯
是神}王国之祖，他是神}和凡人之父。除了神}以外，世界上还有一种唤做精
灵的力量。精灵归属于神}的范畴，只是显得比较缓和，他们的本领也受到一定
的局限。后来，人们又从一种无可捉摸却又神通广大的精灵概念中发展出一种新
的危险的势力，这就是妖孽，或称之为恶魔，他们在希腊神话中也是一支活跃的
力量。　　确切地说，希腊人的宗教产生了不同的根源，打有不同的民族文化的
烙印。希腊宗教经历了漫长而又多变的历史，各种不同的观念相互交织在一起，
互相补充，互相影响，有时甚至激烈地排斥。这里主要涉及到米诺斯文化和古希
腊文化。两种文化密切结合，产生了诗人荷马在波里斯城邦王国崩溃时期所叙述
的希腊人的宗教。　　大约在公元前２０００至１６００年期间，米诺斯文化在
克里特岛达到了高潮时期，从中发展出一种崭新的宗教形式，它的主要特点就是
推崇形形式式的女神。　　米诺斯宗教就其本质说来是一种自然宗教。山洞、地
洞以及礼拜堂等都是祭祀和崇拜的主要场所。后来，人们从中发掘出祭坛、祭祀
壶、圣角以及双面斧。双面斧是这类宗教的主要特征，起先是用它杀死祭供牺牲
的牲口的，后来逐渐成为神圣的标志。　　米诺斯宗教中呈现许多树木或者树枝
的图案，表现了米诺斯宗教对植物的崇拜。在大部分的造型艺术中，人们都可看
到信徒们触摸或者摇动一棵树木的图案。显然，这是一棵具有特殊力量的树。信
徒们的活动十分激烈，让人感到这种信仰是狂喜和放荡的。　　米诺斯艺术中常
常把神}刻画成图象或者烧制在陶罐上。神}们被画成飞鸟，画成动物状的妖魔
或者是动物与人的掺和体。动物与人的掺和艺术原来来自于东方文化的影响。　
　当然，在米诺斯宗教中已经有了人物化的神}形象。　　从大量的出土文物中
可以归结为两大类米诺斯神}，即家庭女神和自然女神。家庭女神的标志是一条
长蛇。

    长蛇原来是家庭的女佑护，后来成为亡灵逝者的象征；而自然女神则把打得
的猎物高高地拎在手上，例如拎着两头倒挂的雄狮等等。　　在希腊神话中，女
神雅典娜反映了第一种类型，而作为动物的女主人阿耳忒弥斯则明显地是一尊自
然女神。　　米诺斯文化在克里特岛崩溃以后却在陆上的迈肯尼王国又信奉其时，
出现了一次新的黄金时代。传播这一文化的载体就是大约在公元前１６００年时
期的阿开亚人。他们从北方地区进入希腊国，征服了当地的土著居民。在公元前
１２世纪，随着多利斯大迁移而进入希腊国的居民其实也是阿开亚的同一种族人，
他们拥有同样的文化，同样的宗教观念。因此，由米诺斯宗教变迁而来的古希腊
宗教也是一种自然宗教，那是由外来民族从他们的家乡携带进去的。　　自然宗
教的基础就是相信清静的大自然里存在一块无可捉摸的势力，他们表现在源泉和
林间，被分别称为海洋女神、水泽女神、森林女神等。森林女神又有多种形态，
如作为酒神巴克科斯的随从西勒诺斯；森林神萨堤罗斯，那是长有公羊角、腿和
尾巴的半人半羊的怪物，耽于淫欲，性喜欢乐，常常是色情狂或者性欲无度的男
子标志；半人半马的肯陶洛斯人和潘纳等。起初，人们想象中的这些善良的精灵
或者与人敌对的自然妖怪还没有人物化。随着时间的推移，人们把这些精灵或妖
魔从神}的集体概念中剥离出来，逐渐形成个人化的单独势力。例如，从主管山
林农业的潘纳神}概念中终于发展出农神潘。传说他的身体像人，腿和脚却是羊，
头上长角，居住在山林里，保护畜牧、猎人。潘喜欢音乐，创制了排箫，又称潘
神箫，还带领山林女神舞蹈游戏，是希腊神话中一尊极具个性的神}. 　　可以
想象，由迁移运动携带而来的其他的诸路神}都有类似的变化历史，因为在很早
以前除了自然精灵以外就已经有了一系列人物化的神}，他们活跃在人们的信仰
世界和天地里。人们信仰的最高神}宙斯打有古代印度日耳曼民族的气象神和光
明神的烙印。人们把他看作万能的家庭主宰，跟宙斯生活在一起的是赫拉。赫拉
的名字中（在希腊语里）含有" 家庭女主人" 的意思。猎人们尊奉阿耳忒弥斯，
她是动物王国的女神。得墨忒耳被称作" 大地之母" ，无疑会受到农民的隆重祭
祀。赫耳墨斯保护室外安全，赫耳墨斯的名字在希腊语中包括" 石块和柱桩" 的
意思，这些都是保护室外，免受袭击的措施。　　古代希腊的宗教随着印度日耳
曼的迁移以及跟爱琴海地区居民的结合而出现了新的变化。自然宗教慢慢地演变
成武士和君主的宗教。诗人荷马为后世留下了可信的证据。当然，荷马的作品中
也包含了两大部分内容，即由他发现并收集的民间素材，和由他自己解释和添加
的文艺素材。　　荷马是按照人的形象塑造神}的，神}凡人化是他的艺术特点。

    从前，古希腊信仰中虽然也常见凡人形态的神}，而荷马却在原来的基础上
又往前发展了一步。他的神}不仅具有人的形状，而且具有人的感觉，能够像人
一样善于思考。荷马的神}跟凡人一样具有欲望，他们感觉饥饿，需要睡觉，会
遇到困难，也会感染疾病，感到害怕、疼痛等等。神}时常跟凡人周旋来往，甚
至产生爱情，生儿育女。动物状的神}是少见的，有的神}出于需要会变化成动
物，如雅典娜有一次变成一只飞鸟。　　当然，神}毕竟是神}，他们有许多凡
人不具备的特征。为区别于凡人，神}被称为生活和乐天者，他们享受天堂般的
安逸、宁静。人类虽然追求幸福，可是他们却常常糟蹋自身的幸福，甚至骗取别
人的幸福，或者通过掠夺别人的幸福从而破坏幸福的概念和价值。为了赞美神}
的安逸，诗人荷马把神}称为美丽的形象，只有火神赫淮斯托斯因为是个跛子算
作例外。

    不过，他也是工艺精巧、心灵优美的神}. 　　神}们并不完全是超自然而
又不可捉摸的，他们犹如迈肯尼时代的贵族一样生活。神}与凡人的距离可以用
贵族与平民的距离相比较。正如凡人不能逾越他的等级界限一样，否则将被视为
亵渎神灵，所以凡人也不能成为神}. 神}是强大而又威力无比的象征，凡人却
受着生命大限的干扰。所以，生、死成为神}和凡人不可逾越的天地界限。　　
神}既然是超越自然的凡人，奥林匹斯圣山就成了他们生活的洞天福地。当然，
奥林匹斯圣山上的神}已经不是脚踏实地的神}了，他们脱离了古老的神}与凡
人的共时、共事、共世的大地，在奥林匹斯圣山上寻得了落脚谋生的故乡。　　
神}们以高山为中心，执掌统管世界的权柄。　　其实，奥林匹斯神}国是按照
迈肯尼时代国王的生活方式和统治方式建设而成的。迈肯尼国王离群索居，躲在
远离民间的宫殿城堡里，他们高高在上，统治全国。神}们也依样画葫芦，他们
在奥林匹斯圣山上组建的神}大家庭犹如一个乌托邦式的大团体。大团体以宙斯
为最高核心，大家同吃同住同议事，共同决定世界的进程。奥林匹斯圣山成为凡
人羡慕却又不能实现的人间天堂。　　希腊人在奥林匹斯神}天堂里塑造了十二
位主神。除了神}之父宙斯和王后赫拉以外，诗人荷马在其作品中把其余的神都
排列了各自的族谱，他们生育繁忙、香烟鼎盛，各神都有垂直的家庭系统，一点
也不紊乱的。这里有智慧女神雅典娜，月亮和狩猎女神阿耳忒弥斯，爱情与美貌
女神阿佛洛狄忒，太阳神阿波罗，战神阿瑞斯，神}使者以及亡灵接引神赫耳墨
斯，宙斯和赫拉的儿子赫淮斯托斯，宙斯的兄弟波塞冬海神，宙斯的另一位兄弟
哈得斯，主管阴司鬼魂，是冥王。另外，谷物女神得墨忒耳，灶神和家室女神赫
斯提，她们在荷马史诗中并不占有重要地位，不过她们毕竟也属于奥林匹斯圣山
上的主神。　　奥林匹斯圣山的神}真是个典型的父母子孙堂，它行使君主立宪
制的政体，一点没有共和制的特色。山上除了十二名常务主神以外，还有一大批
职务低微的下级神}. 彩虹女神伊里斯是服务于宙斯的女佣，该尼墨得斯是众位
神}的侍酒童子，司美女神卡里忒斯组成了阿佛洛狄忒的随从。除此以外，诗人
荷马还经常把一些瞬间的动作人物化和人名化，例如恐惧称为得埃摩斯，纠纷称
作厄里斯，她是战神阿瑞斯的妹妹，不和女神。诗人展开了诗意般的美好的想象，
他把许多姓名化了的概念塞入神}的行列，为灿烂辉煌的神}世界添加了一支特
殊队伍。　　除了凡人化的神}以外，诗人荷马还创造了一批难以捉摸的妖魔势
力，例如表示命运和造化的摩伊拉和阿埃萨。阿埃萨神已经出现在荷马以前的民
间信仰里，他甚至比人物化的神}还要古老。作为主宰命运和死亡的势力，这两
尊神}完全不受后世神}的干扰。他们从生命的方面积极地介入凡人的行动。反
映命运的摩伊拉几乎起着消极的作用，他对宙斯和其他神}则意味着限止权力。

    宗教观念是在不断地发展和变化着的。古希腊的宗教告诉人们举头三尺有神
明，人们相信神}一定生活在地球的某一地方，神}离凡人很近。在荷马宗教里，
神}们已经有了明确的住地，他们生活在奥林匹斯山。可是，这并不排斥神}无
所不在的理论。人们惊奇地发现，神}们神通广大，他们总揽全局，对人世间的
大小事务无所不知，无所不晓。神}是掌握人类命运的高等势力，人类的每一项
活动都是秉承神}的意志，从而为自己赢得辉煌的荣誉或者可耻的惩罚。战争时
期，士兵们积极争取神}的支持。他们认为神}会直接参予战争，并且决定战争
的胜负。　　人生人死是两大自然现象。从前，希腊人认为在死者其实并没有真
正地死去，而是继续存在着。他们只是从坟墓里给人们带来福祉或者灾难。为了
取悦于死者，人们给他们送上许多殉葬品，供他们像活人一样地使用。这里包括
饮料和食品。随着死者灵魂继续生存的意识，人们又创造了一个死者的共同王国，
一致推举哈得斯和珀耳塞福涅作为冥王和冥后，让他们主管死者集居的阴司地府。

    迈肯尼文化崩溃前夕，希腊地区风行焚烧尸体的习惯。这是迁移人带进去的
行为。这时，古希腊的灵魂意识也随着出现变化。人们认为死者的灵魂是没有力
量的阴影图象，随风飘散，没有固定的体形。后来，人们又给死者的灵魂安装了
一副飞行的翅膀，表示行踪不定的意思。　　荷马描述的死者全是哈得斯王国的
居民，他们已经无力左右活人的生活，因为他们是没有意识和没有知觉的存在。

    他们的存在是曾经的存在，是过去的存在。哈得斯王国就其原意来说并没有
被看作惩罚或者表彰的地方，虽然荷马在这里也举有不少的例子，如西绪福斯和
坦塔罗斯。　　西绪福斯是个暴君，死后被罚在地狱把巨石推上山顶。可是每当
他把巨石推到山顶时，巨石又自动地滚落回去。他只得再作努力，重新再推，如
此反复，循环不已。　　坦塔罗斯也是一个有罪的国王，他把自己的儿子珀罗普
斯剁成碎块，烧成佳肴，端给神}们享用。宙斯大怒，体罚他永远站在水中，水
深至下巴。坦塔罗斯想张口喝水时，水势就减退；另外，在他的头顶上还垂挂着
果树。

    果子晶莹可爱。可是，等到他感觉饥饿想吃果子时，树植就地自动升高，让
他可望而不可即，算是对他的罪孽的惩罚。　　不过，哈得斯国从总体上讲主要
还是灵魂聚居之地。死者的灵魂往往在死后都渴望尽快地到达那里。所以，他们
甚至会请求活人，赶快安葬或者火化自己，以使自己在哈得斯王国里迅速寻得安
身之处。　　除了这类观念以外还有一种理论，认为死者虽然成了幽灵、幻影，
可是他们仍然还存在，因此能在某一时刻重新恢复知觉并且开口说话。不过，幽
灵已经无力进行活动，更不能继续他们在尘世间的生活。　　从活人对死者的祭
祀活动中可以推论出人们对死者力量的认识和信仰。诗人荷马虽然一再否认这种
理论，可是就在他生活的那个时代，死者几乎仍然被看作跟神}一样的不可捉摸
的强大势力。　　而希西阿则另辟新径，他创立了又一种新颖的神谱体系。希西
阿在希腊人宗教方面的作用不亚于诗人荷马。他尤其在神谱一书中致力于阐述神
}的形成，阐述世界的形成和现状，创立了自己的神谱。希西阿在描述自己创立
的神}谱系前首先介绍了宇宙的形成：　　天地之初，一片混沌。最古老的神}
卡俄斯主宰一切。卡俄斯无育而娩，从自身分出了大地和爱神厄洛斯，此外还分
出夜晚和黑暗神厄瑞玻斯。厄瑞玻斯是死神和睡神之父。厄洛斯更为神通广大。
他生得稚气可爱，裸体，双翼，携带弓箭在空中飞舞。厄洛斯拥有金箭和铅箭两
种。中了金箭的人将会获得爱情，中了铅箭的人就会失去爱情。大地又自身分出
了星光灿烂的天空、山脉和海洋。厄瑞玻斯和夜晚分出太空以太和白天。　　接
着，诗人又试图解释一切的存在，阐述世界上的一切事物和力量。希西阿坚定地
相信世界充满了神}，他甚至比荷马更致力于造神活动。他把作用于世界的一切
现象都神化，并在神}体系中占有了相应的位置。为此，他命名了三百多位神}，
制定了一部系统的神}排列榜。他自己也对一切存在所表现出的有意识的秩序坚
信不移。这里涉及到三大体系，而这些体系的根源乃在于黑夜、海洋以及天神乌
拉诺斯和大地女神该亚的结合。故事的进一步发展则介绍了统治集团的三代演变
史：即乌拉诺斯、克洛诺斯和宙斯。政权的更迭在这里经历了艰苦的斗争甚至血
腥的冲突。宙斯制服了提坦神以后，登上了世界神}主宰的宝座。从此，神}世
界开创了一个新纪元。正义和秩序战胜了横蛮和混乱，人类把自己的理想推上了
至高无上的地位。　　当然，希西阿的神}理论也同时具有两元论的倾向。他一
方面相信神}之父宙斯的权力统治，可是他又把世界看作一片黑暗和凶恶。这里
就出现了一个严肃的问题：他在神谱理论中把凶恶看作黑夜的后裔，他又把死亡
的暴力，把折磨人类的灾难如贫困、老化、斥责、妒嫉、劳累、饥饿、苦难、欺
骗、纠纷、疾病、癫狂等等称为黑夜的子孙，那么作为大地的儿女，海洋和黑夜
就处于无穷无尽的生死搏斗之中。这场斗争即使在宙斯的合理统治下也仍然无休
止地往下进行着。当然，诗人眼中和笔下的世界是个每况愈下的生活天地，它经
历了天堂乐园一般的黄金时代、白银时代，慢慢地进入战争绵延的铁时代，转入
历史的低谷。希西阿以极其现实主义的眼光打量世界，看到世界上居然有许多的
凶恶。

    可是他毕竟是个虔诚的时代主义者，深信善良和美好，并把宙斯塑造成最高
最完美的表达形式。　　希西阿的神谱理论给神}树立了规范。他的理论几乎成
为凝聚希腊人的锁链。希西阿一方面学习荷马的神}学说，另一方面又与之发生
不断的分岐。他试图让居民们明白他创立神}世界的初衷乃在于解释神}的形成
和存在，而荷马塑造的神}则是一些行动着的人。他们之间的区别在于人物神}
化还是神}人物化。希西阿通过宙斯创造了一个权力无限而又正义合理的世界，
荷马只强调他是最高的一尊神，但是没有强调神}体现着正义。这里反映着两代
诗人所面临的不同的时代特点。希西阿创立了一尊司时令和正义的提克女神。女
神在每一次正义的呼唤中都会显现灵验，她实际上不再是正义作为抽象概念的人
物象征。诗人深信她是一个活的存在和真实。正义存活在世人的心坎里，它是一
种不可逾越的物质力量。历史发展到已经让人们具备认识这重真理的明智阶段。
提克和宙斯组成了本质一致的统一体，她获得了最高荣誉。如果她受到世人的蔑
视，她会奋起反抗，惩罚肇事人，并且向宙斯控诉人们对她的玷污。她的天敌是
肆无忌惮的暴力神，那是一位专给人类造成灾难的女神。　　希西阿把世界万物，
把它们的力量和活动都看作神}，而且对它们坚信不疑。他认为这不是抽象的现
象和模拟的人物，而是真正的神}，是活生生的血肉之躯。后来，随着历史和时
代的进步，人们又修正了他的观念，认为神}列强纯粹是诗意般的想象图案，他
们不是真实的存在，只是神话和造型艺术中的思想轨迹。这是多么辩证而又唯物
的意识！　　这里还有必要阐述一下民间信仰和宗教崇拜。　　宗教崇拜反映了
人们对不可知势力以及神}的信仰。他们试图以崇拜的方式跟神}建立一种默契
和关系，用尊重对方的办法获得对方的恩惠或宽恕。　　宗教崇拜有多种形式。
它的最古老的方式是巫术礼拜。人们尝试着以此赢得尚未拟人化的恐惧势力的支
持。

    因为大部分宗教崇拜方式的历史都早于对人物般的神}的信仰，所以人们把
这一类礼拜称作命运礼拜。于是，人们试图呼风唤雨，抽技发芽，他们把男性生
殖器作为果实的象征，让降福人类的树枝成为农民和牧人向神}表达愿望的传递
信物。

    出于同样的原因，社会生活中形成了许多禁忌的规距。禁忌是由于宗教原因
而宣布确立的限止。它们特别围绕着人类生活的一些自然环节，如出生、婚礼、
死亡等，形成了一系列的禁忌制度。　　宗教礼仪中还包括许多方式的纯净礼仪。
举行宗教活动时必须排除任何不洁的玷污，于是有时用水，有时用硫磺，有时用
乳猪血进行洗礼。巫术和禁忌在希腊宗教中保留了很长时间，它们尤其残留在许
多节日的礼仪之中。今天，人们虽然还并不理解其中古老的原意，可是他们仍然
保留这些礼仪，试图重新寻找其中的解释。　　这里还涉及到祈祷和礼拜。随着
宗教观念的发展，宗教崇拜的形式也在变化。一旦人们相信某些神}的真实存在，
他们在祭祀神}时就会采用相应的崇拜方式，从而促使祭祀效果如同跟神}面对
面进行活动一样。　　这里采用的第一个办法就是大声呼唤神}. 人们常常把诸
多的神}名字连成一串，逐一念诵，以免出现遗漏。人们在呼唤神}时都是面朝
苍天，双手向上伸起，手掌外翻，呼唤神名时一般还需加上有关的地名，因为按
照古老的传说，神}作用范围都受着地域的限制的。除了颂唱赞歌、默念祷告、
颂念主祷文以外，属于宗教崇拜礼仪的还有舞蹈、合唱和行唱。所谓行唱是指许
多人排成队列，一边行进，一边歌唱。还有一类特殊的祷告，就是咒骂。人们在
神}面前庄严请求，请神}对施孽作恶的人加以惩罚，另有一种发誓立愿的，如
果违反誓言，立愿的人将甘心受到惩罚或者自取灭亡。　　礼拜还分家庭礼拜和
国家礼拜两类方式。一室家主，往往是父亲带领全家举行家庭礼拜。家室女神或
灶神赫斯提是举办家庭礼拜的中心地点。父亲常在神像前祭供牺牲，新生婴儿也
由父亲抱着，围着灶神转上一圈，以此表示家庭接纳了这个幼小的生命。国家性
的集体礼拜常由政府的高级官员率领，他们视察大型的宗教祭供活动和场所，在
市议厅里建立象征国家的宗灶。除了高级官员以外，各个神圣所在还有男、女祭
司，祭司的任务是严格地维护教义，负责祭供事务。祭司通常过一段时间后选举
产生，也有世袭或终身担任祭司职务的。　　在古希腊的雅典，贵族在宗教礼拜
期间享有重大的特权。他们可以当祭司，祭司很受世人的青睐。作为祭司，他可
以从信徒们的祭供或庙宇广收的财富中提取一部分作为报酬。　　希腊宗教礼拜
事务中除了祭司以外，预言人也享有重要的地位。希腊人认为，神}是通过某些
信号向人们昭示神意的。因此，他们特别重视对神}信号的理解和阐述。人们对
简单的神意都能理解。另外，社会上还有一批职业里手，他们致力于解释复杂的
神意，这就是预言人的任务。预言人倾听的语言和音调，他们观察天象、如闪电、
打雷、地震、星座位置，分析梦境、鸟儿飞行、注意祭供和占卜等等的环境反应，
成为神}的代理人物，受到人们的敬畏。　　跟预言人工作有关的内容是神谕和
神谕所。在希腊的不少地方都有一些特别的庙宇或者可供询问的场所。解释神谕
的方式也各不相同，一般有格言神谕，信号神谕和梦境神谕等方式。　　最古老
的神谕所是在多多那的宙斯神庙。宙斯对询问者的回答直接通过一棵古栎树的婆
娑声显示。祭司观察其意，然后对询问人解释，授予神谕。　　最重要的格言神
谕是在特尔斐的阿波罗神谕，它对于希腊各部落之间的统一至少起着类似奥林匹
斯圣山一样的作用。阿波罗神庙在古代历史上的几百年时间内不仅是国内政治和
文化生活的宗教中心，也是外民族、外地区居民向往的圣地。在智慧的祭司主持
下，特尔斐神谕享有世界声誉，甚至连一些蛮夷民族碰到重大事务时也专程前去
礼拜请示。所以，特尔斐祭司常常染指并干预历史的进程。他们解释女祭司皮迪
亚说出的深奥莫测的语言。女祭司坐在一只三足鼎上，她的身上附着神}，于是
狂喜得近乎疯癫地作出回答。皮迪亚往往对祭司念诵一首诗文，算是对信徒的答
复，即格言神谕。　　厄比道罗斯是古希腊有名的风景休养区，那里有一座阿斯
克勒庇俄斯的神谕所。阿斯克勒庇俄斯是阿波罗的儿子，职业医生。前来求医的
病人常由祭司和医生照看着，他们躺在阿斯克勒庇俄斯神庙里，等待医疗神}在
梦中传授治病奇方。医疗技术和宗教信仰相互掺合，共同作用，以至于不少病人
最后病愈离去，给神奇的诊所留下不少动人的故事。　　与古罗马人相比较，古
希腊人并不十分注重祖先崇拜。可是，他们却发展出带有自身特点的英雄崇拜。

    祖先崇拜往往是某一个家庭的事，而希腊人把一些重要的死者，即英雄看作
是整个民族的公共祖先。他们不仅把历史上一些重要的个人当作崇拜的英雄，甚
至连一些神话中的人物和古老的神}，如赫拉克勒斯，如珀罗普斯，都被树为全
民族崇拜的英雄偶像。跟法力无边的神}相比较，英雄们全都打上地区作用的烙
印，这跟埋葬他们尸体的坟墓所在地有着直接的关系。地区的局限性使得英雄们
比起神}来距离人们想象中的概念更接近、更亲切。在波斯战争时期，希腊的英
雄崇拜达到了它的顶峰时期。希腊人相信，他们取得战胜波斯人的辉煌成果，除
了应该感谢众多的神}以外，还应该感谢保佑地方的诸位英雄。　　感谢神}和
感谢英雄的办法就是向他们祭供牺牲。祭供牺牲是与祷告相连的一种宗教活动。
所谓祭供即是端出供品，借以稳定和神}间的关系，取得神}的恩宠。人们在出
于某种特别愿望时，往往于摆出祭品的同时呼唤有关的神}名称。希腊人甚至相
信可以通过大宗的祭供买得神}的恩惠，他们感到祭供愈大，愈会受到神}的宠
爱。

    这里倒是活生生地反映了当时的社会心理和弊端。　　祭供的形式一般分两
种：血腥祭供和非血腥祭供。这两类祭供方式都是十分流行的，无论是私宅个人
或是公众团体都不出这样的两类祭供方式。举办祭供时常把牺牲物品烧掉，也有
不烧的，把祭品直接端送到神像面前。作为公众团体的成员，每个人都有义务祭
供神}，否则，便会被视为对团体的犯罪。　　进行非血腥祭供时常常摆上各式
糕点。

    人们发现即使在祭供牲口时，也不忘在牲口身上撒一些大麦或大麦面。这里
反映了非血腥祭供的由来和历史。比较流行的是把切碎的肉裹在面糊糊里烧化。
面糊糊呈稠软状，和上蜂蜜，然后投入火中烧尽。除了糕饼以外，各类水果或者
野果，尤其是葡萄甚至橄榄枝条，当然也有乳酪和蜂巢，这些都是非血腥祭供的
上等佳品。　　血腥祭供又分两种形式：膳食祭供，这时候神}只能得到一部分
牲口或动物；另一种方法则是把宰杀的牲口或动物全部烧掉祭供。膳食祭供习惯
于作感谢或请求神}. 神}可以从宰杀牲口中得到某一特定的部分。血腥祭供一
般是给冥界神}提供祭礼，给死者以及英雄们祭供牺牲。这里涉及到重归和好、
忏悔赎罪以及立誓愿的祭礼。这时，人们把牺牲全部烧掉。他们相信，吃过这类
祭供物的神}会帮助凡人完成诸多的愿望和任务。　　膳食祭供的过程是这样的
：牵来一头祭供的牲口，一般是一头牛，一只羊或一头猪。牲口头上戴着花环，
被送上祭坛。主持祭供的祭司手拿一块燃烧的木板，他将木板浸入水中，弹洒祭
坛、参加祭礼的众人和祭供的牲口。然后，由祭司本人，或者由在场的人抓一把
大麦投入火中，洒在宰杀的牲口头上。一名神职人员随后发问：" 谁在这里？"
在场的人一致回答：" 许多好人！" 因为参加祭礼的人必须纯洁，不能沾染罪孽。
接着分发祭礼，周围一片寂静，大家进行祷告。有人趁着笛声宰杀牲口。牲口血
一般流在祭坛上，或者用盛器接住，然后涂抹在祭坛上。牲口脑袋被切下以后，
人们再剔出内脏和骨头，把肉分类。内脏和骨头主要用来祭供。有时，人们也把
牲口的肉烧掉，用以显示重要的祭供活动。等到祭司宣告祭礼的良好效果时，人
们又会吹笛助兴，然后烧烤牲口肉，每人都应该吃上一块。古希腊人举办的百牲
大祭，除了借以表彰神}外，也包括宴请众人的意思。　　与这类祭供相连的还
包括忏悔和死者祭礼。这类祭礼通常是给赐福予人的大地神明或者给地下世界的
阴暗势力表示意向，借以缓和他们的愤怒，防止伤害。人们趁深夜或傍晚在低矮
而又空心的祭坛前宰杀一头黑猪或黑牛，牛血从祭坛上流下去，或者从空心的陶
器脚底流入地下，而牛的身体将被彻底烧掉。　　死者祭礼往往是在举办葬礼、
在葬礼以后的第３天和第９天以及在每个月的３０号进行的活动。另外，它还在
万灵祭日举行。让死者饮血的礼仪来源于民间简单的认识。古希腊人认为死者身
上没有了流动的血液，他们会十分向往饮血。随着时间的推移，血腥祭礼的风俗
越来越少，人们慢慢地取用纯洁的美酒、牛奶、蜂蜜、清水和香油等作为祭品。
　　除了祭礼活动以外，希腊人还有许多宗教节日和庆祝活动。希腊人和罗马人
一样，他们都不太注重安息日或星期日，相反，他们却创造了许多节日。节日分
布在整整一年的时间里。家庭生活中往往围绕着添丁、婚礼和葬礼举行庆祝活动，
国家举办不少团体庆祝活动，这类活动都带有宗教信仰的色彩。今天，人们几乎
难以列举希腊国共有多少节日的数目，因为每尊神}，每个英雄都可能受到一些
个人的、团体的、城市的或全希腊的庆祝和纪念，从而形成一个特定或特殊的节
日。

    有些节日是属于全希腊性的。全希腊性的节日对希腊民族具有特别重大的意
义和光彩。例如大型的国家运动会，它标志着人民对某一神}的尊重和崇敬。运
动会期间缔结神}和平日，各个集团和家族之间不得发生战事。在运动会开幕式
上，人们向众位神}祭供牺牲，运动员立誓遵守比赛规则。运动会一般举行几天
时间，最后一天分发奖品，期间还穿插一些文艺活动，全都用来表彰神}的恩德。

    所谓的文艺活动一般分体操活动、马类活动、音乐和戏剧活动。后来，人们
从这类活动中发展出古典的五项竞技，即在同一天由同一名竞技者参加跳远、竞
走、掷铁饼，甚至上演喜剧、悲剧、神怪戏等等。　　古希腊共进行四大国家性
的运动会，其中以奥林匹克运动会为最重要。奥林匹克运动会每４年举行一次，
以此纪念并表彰神}之父宙斯。另外的三大运动会是指在特尔斐附近举办的皮迪
恩运动会，纪念太阳神阿波罗；伊斯泰弥运动会，由科林斯人每３年举行一次，
纪念海神波塞冬；尼密阿运动会，纪念报应女神涅墨西斯。除了这些角逐竞赛以
外还有一系列的节日，如亚各斯为纪念赫拉举办的赫拉节，底比斯庆祝赫拉克勒
斯节，科林斯纪念阿佛洛狄忒节，埃比道罗斯举行阿斯克勒庇俄斯节。在阿波罗
诞生的特洛斯岛每年都有阿波罗节日，亚加狄亚人隆重纪念吕卡翁的活动。　　
另外，如同希腊国的各座城市一样，雅典城也致力于隆重庆祝诸多的神}节日。
尤其为了纪念雅典娜，城市确立了许多节日。雅典娜大祭典是最主要的庆祝活动。
大祭典每３年举办一次，每次需要６天时间。雅典娜大祭典是古老的庆典活动，
它的高潮是在百牛大祭的第３天，这一天被看作雅典娜的生日。在这天到来前，
由抽签方式决定的１０选手举行各式比赛。如同国家运动会一样，目的是让神}
喜欢的内容样样俱全。庆祝女神生日时还要举办一回夜晚火把赛跑。等到节日的
清晨，人们虔诚地集队而行，前往城堡。雅典的居民们自由地组成行进的队伍，
为首的走着希腊的执政官、将军、女神的司库等人。后面跟着骑士、驾车手、角
逐竞赛的胜者、附庸国以及异邦城市派遣的使者。外国侨民手执圣礼、祭礼、圣
器、祭饼等，祭司和仆人们抬着祭供的牲口。雅典城内首富之家的姑娘和妇女们
给女神织造一件漂亮的衣衫，她们给女神披上衣衫以后再在祭坛前摆上牺牲，接
着便是全民欢宴。　　国家从国库中支付大部分就餐费用。　　希腊最古老的节
日应该是显示季节的得墨忒耳节。从埃琉西斯出土文物中可以看出，早在迈肯尼
时代就有得墨忒耳崇拜祭礼。诗人荷马曾经讲到打谷和谷场节。这个节日虽然没
有进入公众的日历，可是它却在民间受到欢迎和庆祝。正如许多自然节日一样，
谷物女神得墨忒耳也扮演着重要的角色。她和她的女儿珀耳塞福涅冥后受到同样
的尊重。

    有时候，她们再加上酒神狄俄尼索斯组成联盟。　　为纪念得墨忒耳，希腊
国留下许多的收获感谢节。其中有一个节日只能由妇女参加庆祝，那是得墨忒耳
祭典。

    它像神秘庆祝的方式一样，让妇女们为之求获生育子女和幸福。妇女们藏匿
在树叶搭成的茅屋里，通过禁食和禁欲虔诚地等候节日。人们把活的小猪仔推入
山渊，以后再把腐烂的猪仔伴和种子播种。节日的最后一天常常是尽情地玩耍和
取闹，人们演戏、跳舞，尽兴欢乐。　　相传得墨忒耳跟宙斯生下女儿柯莱，即
珀耳塞福涅。柯莱被哈得斯劫去，她在冬天时间里当哈得斯的妻子，即冥后。得
墨忒耳一路寻找女儿，她来到埃琉西斯。正当她精疲力竭，心情十分沮丧地坐在
井栏边时，她看到面前走来几位公主。公主们把得墨忒耳领到国王面前。为感谢
国王的热情招待，得墨忒耳给国王的儿子特里普托勒摩斯传授农艺本领。特里普
托勒摩斯再将农艺技术发扬光大，让许多人都学会，成了各自谋生的手段和本领。

    到公元前５世纪，这些起先都带有地方色彩的节日都发展成为全希腊统一的
节日。

    人们对节日寄托了来世幸福的热切希望，对得道成神和灵魂超脱表示了忠诚
的信仰。当然，促使这重信仰的既不是荷马宗教，也不是国家崇拜，而是罗马时
期具有吸引力的神秘的习俗，甚至连一些皇帝也被卷入其中，例如马尔克。奥雷
尔。

    忒奥多茜二世禁止当时的宗教礼拜。而希腊人则更加追求风俗的纯洁，他们
建造了收留信徒的宗教堂，举行圣礼活动，希望作用于凡人死后的灵魂生活。　
　必须看到，希腊宗教与国家之间有着密切的联系，它要求一种集体性的虔诚。
因此，人们的宗教需要造成了新的团体和形式。这类发展不仅从得墨忒耳崇拜中
可以看出，从对酒神狄俄尼索斯的崇拜礼仪中也可得出同样的明确的结论。古希
腊人在每年１２月都会尽兴纵情地庆祝乡村的或团体性的狄俄尼索斯节。而４月
份举办的大型狄俄尼索斯节更为重要，它是雅典城内除了雅典娜以外最大的庆祝
活动。

    节日开始时首先演出一些悲剧的节目，以表彰节日的传统和历史。人们从皮
洛斯发掘的陶碑上看到，希腊人在公元前１３世纪时就已经熟悉狄俄尼索斯节。
自然，酒神在荷马史诗中尚不占有起眼的地位，这也许是跟君主和武士宗教不能
相互适应和配合的缘故。直到公元前８世纪，古老的贵族世界崩溃以后，色雷斯
地区才掀起崇拜狄俄尼索斯酒神的节日活动。起先，主要是妇女们和一些对完成
规定的宗教礼仪不感兴趣的人们积极地参加狂欢活动。人们如饥似渴地寻求一位
新的神}，希望满足大家对生活的兴趣。醉意朦胧、醉态可爱的酒神狄俄尼索斯
是再合适不过的艺术般的创造和选择。　　它的庆祝方式是这样的：夜晚时分，
妇女们装扮成酒神侍女来到漆黑一片的树林里，准备寻找她们的神}. 她们戴着
假面具，趁着酒兴狂歌狂舞，纵情欢乐，最后一起抓住一头动物，把动物撕碎，
吃下一块块生肉。疯狂之中，她们把动物都看作神}的化身。　　狄俄尼索斯节
日经历了很长时间的周折，最后才成为全希腊的一重宗教信仰。可是，男人们对
妇女们近乎癫狂而又野蛮的庆祝活动十分反感，然而它毕竟符合希腊人的生活习
俗和追求，符合希腊人的精神风貌，特别可贵的是，由于激烈的狄俄尼索斯活动
还引伸出一重美丽的果实，开始了悲剧戏的上演，于是，酒神节又成了大家喜闻
乐见的活动。

    人们对信仰的追求是永无止境的，他们从无限而又无法满足的渴望中又迸发
出一种宗教方式。这类方式按照色雷斯的神话般的歌手俄耳甫斯命名，称作俄耳
甫斯教派。这里没有激烈的狄俄尼索斯的狂欢活动，却有着严格的禁欲主义的生
活方式和强烈要求内心纯洁的神秘教义。人们似乎听到了来世的法庭审判，听到
灵魂摆脱各类罪孽，摆脱惩罚的转变进程。他们相信，由于灵魂是雅典娜吹上一
口神气所形成的，因此灵魂自身也是神}般的，而躯体只是灵魂的监狱。　　俄
耳甫斯教派在公元前７世纪至６世纪对希腊哲学发生很大的影响。古希腊的哲学
家和数学家毕达哥拉斯和恩姆泼杜克拉斯都曾经是这一教派的热情信徒。它跟其
它的一些精神潮流相结合，长期影响着希腊的思想和文化发展。　　除了狂喜和
神秘的精神潮流以外，古老的虔诚信仰还在一定的方式下保持着它的原有风貌。

    这里的理论基础是合理，即合乎规律。人类努力地希望与众位神}保持和平，
希望寻得平静的安全，他们愿意把自己的一切献给神}. 公平是这类活动的基础，
违反公平的人必须受到惩罚。人类卷入了罪孽，所以出现了净化自身和灵魂的思
想。起先，净化只是作为宗教活动的惯例，后来成为道德规范。这重信仰是跟特
尔斐的阿波罗密切相连的。　　阿波罗原先是一个农神和牧神，同时他又是忏悔
神和医疗神。他有个儿子名叫阿斯克勒庇俄斯，是个著名的医生，可以帮助凡人
抵制大地上的阴暗势力。阿波罗后来又成为艺术神。对希腊人说来，他的最大的
作用在于是一位发布神谕的先知。阿波罗在公元前８世纪时曾在许多地方受到祭
奉，最著名的是特尔斐神庙。它提出严格的要求，要求纯洁，即通过滴洒鲜血保
持纯洁或去除污点。污点不仅沾染个人，有时会连带整个家族。所以，人们特别
注重遵守法规，注重忏悔。阿波罗信仰和法律观念是相互隶属的，它为后世的文
学家们提供了丰富的题材。　　随着时代精神的发展和变化，在希腊人逐渐对奥
林匹斯神}攻击的文化运动中，阿斯克勒庇俄斯教派逐渐在雅典立足生根。人们
把这尊神}看作是一条蛇。公元前４２０年时，古希腊悲剧作家索福克勒斯（公
元前４９６- ４０６）把一条蛇接入自己的屋子，他给神}谱写了礼拜歌，并为
之设立了祭坛。阿斯克勒庇俄斯教派从埃比道罗斯移植到雅典，这位神}和他的
女儿海基雅在那里寻得了巨大的礼拜场所。他在埃比道罗斯时被视为帮助健康的
英雄，在帖撒利受到地区性的崇拜，到了雅典以后成为希腊国的医务健康神。他
的教派逐渐发展，竟至于遍布整个地中海世界。　　正如希腊的神}崇拜一直可
以追溯到迈肯尼时代一样，希腊的英雄传说出于相同的历史时期，因为围绕诸位
英雄活动的地点几乎是迈肯尼文化的主要场所。希腊的神}传说和英雄传说是全
希腊文学的精神支柱和前提，也是构成《希腊神话故事》的主要内容。　　神话
跟历史时代并不确定的童话毕竟是有所区别的。神话是一个没有文字记载的民族
的历史回忆。神话跟产生神话的时代起着相互调节的作用，它塑造着一个新的历
史时代，并且又被打上新时代的烙印。追求荣誉，用美化的想象衬托着神话，使
它来自生活而高于生活。神话故事中的主题大都是英雄的创举和折磨，是各种命
运的行为和遭遇。古希腊的迈肯尼时代以及后世，尤其在骑士文化时代都喜欢战
斗传说，因此这类故事大都跟国王、贵族或将军们的行为有着友好或敌对的联系。

    正如希腊神话所显示的内容一样，围绕着统治集团或家族的住地常常出现许
多地方性的传说，例如在亚哥利斯流行阿特柔斯及其后裔的故事，帖撒利流行半
人半马的肯陶洛斯人和拉庇泰人以及珀琉斯的故事，底比斯人不会忘掉俄狄甫斯
和他的父亲拉伊俄斯，他们不会忘掉七英雄征战底比斯和厄庇戈诺伊后辈英雄。
雅典与克里特岛的关系深刻地反映在弥诺斯和忒修斯的传说之中。当然，希腊神
话中最大的故事还是围绕着特洛伊战争而逐步展开涟漪的。　　在古希腊，英雄
传说是荷马之前的最大的精神产品。多里斯民族迁移赶走了阿开亚人。阿开亚人
不忘故土，他们精心保留了古老的回忆，作为民族的精神财富。在异国他乡生活
的漫长岁月里，人们通过相互间的融合、交换、互译，通过吸收自由的传说艺术
和童话题材，慢慢地凝聚出如奥德修斯和阿耳戈英雄的精彩传说。后来，多里斯
人接受了希腊英雄传说，他们还为之增加了自己的内容，于是，英雄传说也就演
变成全希腊的文化财富。　　希腊神话经历了丰富的时代变迁和历史风云，它几
乎成为希腊乃至欧洲一切文学和艺术活动的基本素材。它从传说进入歌咏，从歌
咏进入故事，从故事进入戏剧，最后进入通行全希腊的史诗，而且还在罗马文化
中生根落户。从此以后，它为自身寻得了进入拉丁文和古德语的渠道，成为全欧
洲的文化宝藏。今天，欧美的戏剧、诗歌和其他的文化活动都在滔滔不绝流经于
世的希腊神话中汲取新的营养，成为文艺再创造的重要源泉。　　伟大的２０世
纪一步步地进入它的尾声。放眼世界，人类有理由为千百年的社会进步和科学成
就感到自豪。他们由衷地认识到：神是没有的，然而反映历史，反映文化，反映
人类精神风貌的神话故事却是美好的、永恒的。它记录了人类追求生活的无限理
想和希望，同时却又库存了人类多少为了争取未来而洒落的汨汨泪水和琅琅笑声。

    一部波澜壮阔的《希腊神话故事》就在这样美好的文化氛围和悲壮的历史时
期里掀开了它那令世界难以忘怀的扉页。（艾英）

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事36：奥德修斯的胜利

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    在拉厄耳忒斯的庄园里，他们欢乐地用完午餐。但他们仍然围着桌子，听奥
德修斯讲述他的故事。最后他说：" 我有一种预感，我们的对手正在城里准备对
付我们。我们最好派一个人去侦察，看看外面的动静。一个仆人站起来，走了出
去。他还没有走多远，就看见一群全副武装的人向庄园涌来。他惊慌地跑回来，
大声说：" 他们来了，奥德修斯，他们已经到了庄园门口！你们快准备战斗！"
坐着的人赶忙跳起来，拿起武器。奥德修斯，他的儿子，两个牧人，还有仆人的
总管多利俄斯的六个儿子，组成了一支队伍，最后年老的多利俄斯和拉厄耳忒斯
也参加进来。奥德修斯领着他们冲出了大门。　　他们刚到门外，高贵的女神帕
拉斯。雅典娜变形为门托尔，也加入他们的队伍。奥德修斯一眼就认出了女神，
他非常高兴，更充满了信心和希望。" 这是什么日子啊，" 拉厄耳忒斯喊道，"
我是多么高兴啊！我们祖孙三代人并肩作战！" 　　帕拉斯。雅典娜跑来对老人
耳语道：" 阿耳克西俄斯的儿子哟，你是我最看中的勇士，快向宙斯和他的女儿
祈祷吧，然后勇敢地掷出你的矛。" 拉厄耳忒斯立即向宙斯和雅典娜祈祷，并掷
出他的长矛。长矛击中敌人的首领奥宇弗忒斯的头盔，穿透了他的面颊。奥宇弗
忒斯跌倒在地上死了。　　奥德修斯和忒勒玛科斯率领同伴们如愤怒的狮子冲入
羊群一样，向敌人突击。他们用利剑和长矛刺杀敌人，几乎把敌人全都杀死了。

    这时帕拉斯。雅典娜立即出来让他们停止砍杀。她用神}的声音喊道：" 伊
塔刻的公民们，退出这场不幸的战斗吧，赶快退出战斗！你们已经流够了鲜血，
双方立即停止战斗！" 　　雷鸣般的声音震得敌人手中的武器都掉落在地上。他
们望风而逃，向城里奔去，只希望保住一条命。　　奥德修斯和他的伙伴们听到
女神的声音倍受鼓舞，他们挥舞武器向敌人追去。变形为门托尔的雅典娜走在最
前面。

    可是，宙斯要求和平。这位万神之父朝女神脚前降下一道闪电。女神停住了
脚步，转身对奥德修斯说：" 拉厄耳忒斯的儿子，抑制你的好战情绪吧！否则，
无比强大的雷霆之主会发怒的。" 奥德修斯和他的伙伴们听从了她的劝告。雅典
娜把他们带到城里的市场上，并派使者去召唤市民前来集会。宙斯的愿望实现了。
他们都平静下来，消除了愤怒。变形为门托尔的雅典娜让奥德修斯和人民订立神
圣的盟约。他们尊奉奥德修斯为国王和保护人。奥德修斯被欢呼的人群簇拥着回
到宫殿。珀涅罗珀头戴花冠，身穿节日的盛装，带领一群女仆从宫中出来欢迎。

    这对重新团聚的夫妇又幸福地生活了许多年。正如预言家提瑞西阿斯在地府
中预言的那样，奥德修斯到高龄才安详地去世。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事35：平息城里的叛乱

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    伊塔刻的城里传开了求婚人惨遭杀害的消息。死者的亲属从各方面涌来，奔
向王宫。他们在宫院的角落里发现了一大堆尸体。他们大声号哭，并扬言要为死
者报仇。伊塔刻人把尸体抬到城外安葬。从邻近岛屿来的人把尸体抬上船，运回
故乡安葬。　　然后，死者的父母兄弟和其他亲戚聚集在市场上，举行国民大会。

    参加会议的人很多，求婚人安提诺俄斯的父亲奥宇弗忒斯首先发言。　　他
哭泣着说：" 朋友们，你们想一下，我向你们控诉的这个人，给伊塔刻和邻近地
区带来多少灾难和不幸啊！二十年前，他带着我们英勇的年轻人，乘船出发。现
在，船毁人亡，就他一人归来。他回来后，又杀死我们民族中这么多高贵的青年。
大家来呀，趁他还没有来得及逃往皮洛斯和厄利斯之前，让我们把他抓住！" 在
场的人看到他声泪俱下，都非常同情他，正准备出发去追捕时，歌手菲弥俄斯和
使者墨冬从宫中来到市场上。他们看到宫中还有两个人活着，都很吃惊。墨冬请
求发言，他大声说：" 伊塔刻的男人们，请听我说。我敢发誓，奥德修斯做的这
件事，是神}决定的。我亲眼看见一位神}变成门托尔，时时保护着奥德修斯。

    就是这个神}将求婚人杀死了。这是神意啊！" 　　听到使者的话，他们都
很害怕。这时，预言家玛斯托耳的儿子哈利忒耳塞斯，一个白发苍苍的老人站起
来说：" 伊塔刻的市民们，请听我说，现在发生的这一切事，都得由你们负责。
过去，你们为什么听任求婚人胡作非为？为什么不听我和门托尔的忠告，放纵你
们狂妄的儿子在宫里肆意饮宴，挥霍别人的财产，还要挟他的妻子呢？现在宫中
出现的这场悲剧真是咎由自取。你们如果是聪明人，就不应该去追捕他。他只是
为了家庭的安定，尽了他应尽的义务。如果你们违背神意，等待你们的将是更大
的灾难。

    " 　　哈利忒耳塞斯的话刚说完，人群中骚动起来，形成了两派：有的人赞
同老人的意见，有的人支持奥宇弗忒斯的主张。拥护奥宇弗忒斯的人武装起来，
在城外集合。奥宇弗忒斯站在队伍的最前面，准备为死去的亲人报仇。　　帕拉
斯。

    雅典娜在奥林匹斯圣山上俯视，看见一群人准备叛乱，于是，她来到父亲宙
斯面前，说：" 万神之父啊，请告诉我，你的决定是什么？你是想通过战争解决
伊塔刻人的争端呢，还是想和平解决？" 　　" 女儿哟，你想听到怎样的决定呢？
" 宙斯回答说，" 你不是已经决定，并经我同意，让奥德修斯回归故乡，并向求
婚人复仇吗？既然我已同意，你就可以随意去做吧。不过，如果你想听听我的意
见，那就听着：奥德修斯已惩罚了求婚人，他永为国王，并在一个神圣的盟约中
立誓。

    我们神}应该让死者的亲属忘记他们的痛苦，使他们像从前一样，和国王友
好相处，使伊塔刻王国繁荣昌盛。" 　　女神听到这话很高兴。她离开奥林匹斯
圣山，飞过云空，降落在伊塔刻的岛上。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事34：奥德修斯和拉厄耳忒斯

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    第二天清晨，奥德修斯作好了出门的准备。他对珀涅罗珀说：" 我们两人已
经饮完人生的苦酒，现在，我们阔别重逢，并重新成了宫殿的主人。你应该照看
好宫中的财产。我现在必须到乡下去，看看我的父亲。求婚人被杀的消息迟早会
传出去，因此我劝你，最好跟女仆们暂时避开，免得好奇的人向你打听。" 说着，
奥德修斯背上利剑，并唤醒忒勒玛科斯和两个牧人，他们三人也带上武器。

    日出时分，奥德修斯和他们一起穿过街道，走出城去。帕拉斯。雅典娜降下
一层浓雾，遮住他们。　　一路上，谁也没有看见他们。　　不一会，他们来到
年老的拉厄耳忒斯的美丽的庄园。这是他买来扩充祖业的第一座田庄。庄园的中
心是一排住宅，周围是厨房、马厩、仓库和耕种田地的长工们的住房。一个年老
的西西里女仆在这块寂寞的乡下为主人料理杂务。奥德修斯来到门口，转身对跟
随而来的人说：" 你们先进去，杀一口肥猪，准备好午餐。我先到田里去，或许
我的父亲在那里耕作。我要看看他能不能认出我来。我会马上和他回来的，然后
我们再欢欢喜喜地用餐。" 　　说着，他向田地走去，先到了果园，在这里他没
有看到一个园丁。他们都下地去砍伐树木了，准备建围篱。奥德修斯只看到他的
老父亲在整修葡萄藤。老人看上去像个长工一样，身上穿了一件满是补丁的肮脏
的粗布衣服，腿上打着一副皮套，手上带着手套，头上戴着一顶羊皮帽。奥德修
斯看到父亲这副寒酸的样子，心里很痛苦。他真想扑上去拥抱父亲，吻他的脸颊。
但他担心父亲会承受不了突如其来的欢乐，因此，他决定让父亲先有一点心理准
备。

    他走到父亲面前，小心地试探说：" 老人家，你看来很精通园艺。葡萄、橄
榄、无花果、梨树、苹果树都照料得很好；花畦和菜畦也料理得好极了。只是有
一点你忽视了，请恕我直言，千万别生气：你好像没有受到很好的照顾，身上穿
得破破烂烂的，而且很肮脏！你的主人不该这样亏待你。你能不能告诉我，你的
主人是谁？你为谁在料理果园？刚才我遇到一个人，他告诉我，这里就是伊塔刻。
这难道是真的吗？不过，刚才那个人非常不友好。我向他打听我的一个朋友是否
还在这里时，他爱理不理的，没有回答我。我以前在国内招待过一个贵宾，他是
伊塔刻人，并告诉我，他是拉厄耳忒斯国王的儿子。临别时，我送给他许多珍贵
的礼物！" 　　奥德修斯善于编造故事。拉厄耳忒斯听了抬起头来，含着泪说：
" 善良的外乡人，你的确来到了你想寻找的国家。不过这里也住着许多卑鄙而傲
慢的人，他们贪得无厌，你即使用多少礼物送给他们，也难以满足他们的欲望。
你所要寻找的那个人已经不在人世了。如果你真能在伊塔刻见到他，他将会怎样
盛情报答你对他的好意啊！但请你告诉我，你是什么时候招待这个客人的？唉，
他是我的儿子，他现在像石头一样，沉在海里了。哦，我忘了问你，你是谁，从
哪里来，到哪里去？你的船停在哪里，你的同伴呢？" 　　" 尊敬的老人，" 奥
德修斯回答说，" 让我告诉你吧，我是厄珀里托斯，是阿吕巴斯的阿菲达斯的儿
子。

    一场风暴将我的船从西卡尼亚刮到你们的海岸，它现在停在离城不远的地方。
你的儿子奥德修斯离开我的家乡已有五年了。他临走时非常高兴，并有飞鸟预示
了一种吉兆。我们彼此都希望常常见面，互赠珍贵的礼物。" 　　年迈的拉厄耳
忒斯突然感到眼前发黑。他用双手抓了一把黑土，洒在他的白发上，并大声悲泣
起来。奥德修斯心痛欲裂，猛地朝父亲冲上去，拥抱他，吻着他，并大声说："
父亲，我就是你所打听的人！过了二十年我终于回到了家乡。擦干你的眼泪吧，
一切痛苦都已经过去了。我告诉你一个好消息：求婚人都被我杀死了。我是奥德
修斯！" 　　拉厄耳忒斯吃惊地注视着他，终于忍不住地喊道：" 如果你真是奥
德修斯，如果你真是我的儿子，就请露出一个明显的证据，使我可以相信。" 奥
德修斯说：" 亲爱的父亲，请你看看这块伤疤吧，这是一头野猪给我留下的伤痕。
此外，还有一个证据：我想把你以前给我的树木指给你看。当我童年时，你带我
去果园，我们走在果树之间，你指着各种果树，告诉我它们是什么树。最后，你
送给我十三棵梨树，十棵苹果树、四十棵无花果树和五十株葡萄藤。" 　　老人
完全相信了，一下倒在儿子的怀里，晕了过去。奥德修斯用强壮的手臂紧紧抱住
父亲。当他恢复知觉后，大声呼叫：" 啊，宙斯和诸位神}啊，你们还在保护我
们，使那些求婚人受到应得的惩罚！可是，我的儿子，你刚回来，我又得为你担
心了。你把伊塔刻和附近海岛上的许多贵族的儿子都杀了，整个城市和邻近地区
的人都会联合起来反对你啊。" 　　" 亲爱的父亲，请放心吧！" 奥德修斯安慰
他说，" 你不必为此担心，带我回你的屋子里去吧。忒勒玛科斯、牧牛人和牧猪
人都在那里，他们已经准备了午餐。" 　　他们回到屋子里，看见忒勒玛科斯和
两个牧人正在切肉斟酒。拉厄耳忒斯先由老仆人伺候沐浴，涂抹香膏，然后穿上
华丽的长袍。在他穿衣时，女神帕拉斯。雅典娜悄悄地走近他，使他挺直了腰，
变得高大而威严。他走出来后，奥德修斯看到他，惊讶不已。最后，他们欢乐地
坐在一起，共进午餐。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事33：奥德修斯和珀涅罗珀

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    欧律克勒阿急忙来到女主人的内室，走到珀涅罗珀的床前，欣喜地唤醒正在
熟睡的珀涅罗珀，并对她说：" 可爱的女儿，快快醒来。你日夜盼望的人已经回
来了！奥德修斯已经回来了！他已将那些让你担惊受怕的求婚人全都杀死了！"
珀涅罗珀睡眼惺忪地说：" 欧律克勒阿，你在说胡话吧？你为什么用这种话把我
惊醒呢？" 　　" 王后，请你别生气，" 欧律克勒阿说，" 他们在大厅里所嘲弄
的那个外乡人，那个乞丐就是奥德修斯，其实，你的儿子忒勒玛科斯早就知道了，
可是，在完成对求婚人的复仇之前，他必须保守秘密。" 　　这时，王后一骨碌
从床上跳起来，抱住了老人，眼泪扑簌簌地滚落下来。" 这是真的吗？如果奥德
修斯真的在宫里，他一个人怎能对付得了那么多的求婚人？" 　　" 这我既没有
看到，也没有听到，" 欧律克勒阿回答说，" 我们女仆都被关在内廷。后来，你
的儿子来叫我时，我看到你的丈夫正站在一堆尸体中间。现在尸体已拖出去了。

    我把整个房子用硫磺熏了一遍。你不用怕，可以去了。" 　　" 那么，让我
们去吧！" 珀涅罗珀说，她因满怀着恐惧和希望而颤抖。她们走出大厅。珀涅罗
珀默默地站在奥德修斯的面前，炉火在熊熊燃烧。奥德修斯垂着头，看着地上，
等待她先说话。王后又惊又疑，仍然没有开口。过了一会儿，她好像觉得那是她
的丈夫，但又感到他仍是一个外乡人，一个衣服破烂的乞丐。忒勒玛科斯忍不住
了，几乎是恼怒地，但仍然带着微笑地说：" 母亲，你为什么一动不动地站在那
里？

    坐到父亲身边去，仔细看看他，并且问他呀！哪有一个女人跟丈夫分别二十
年后，看到丈夫回来，还像你这样无动于衷的？难道你的心硬似石头，没有感情
吗？" " 呵，亲爱的儿子，" 珀涅罗珀回答说，" 我已经惊讶得呆住了。我不能
说话，不能问他，甚至也不能看他！可是，如果这真的是他，是我的奥德修斯回
来了，我们自会互相认识的，因为我们都有别人不知道的秘密标记。" 奥德修斯
听到这里，朝儿子转过身子，温和地微笑着说：" 让你的母亲来试探我吧！她之
所以不敢认我，是因为我穿了这身讨厌的破衣服。但我相信她会认出我的。现在，
我们首先得考虑一下其他的事情。如果一个人在国内杀死了一个同族的人，那他
就得弃家逃走，即使他的权势大，不怕有人来替死者复仇。现在，我们杀死了国
内和附近海岛的许多年轻的贵族，那可不是一件小事。我们该怎么办呢？" " 父
亲，" 忒勒玛科斯说，" 你是世界上最聪明的人，这得由你作出决定。" " 我愿
意告诉你们，" 奥德修斯回答说，" 最明智的办法应该是这样的：你，还有两个
牧人，以及屋里所有的人，都应该先去沐浴更衣，而且要穿上最华丽的衣服。女
仆们也该穿上最漂亮的衣服。然后，歌手弹琴奏乐。这时从门外走过的人一定以
为我们这里还在举行庆宴。求婚人被杀的消息便不会传出去。同时我们准备到乡
下的田庄去，以后的事，神}一定会告诉我们该怎么做。" 　　不一会，宫里传
出一片琴声和歌舞声，门外的大街上挤满了人，他们猜测说：" 一定是珀涅罗珀
选定了她的丈夫，宫里正在举行婚礼呢！" 直到傍晚时，人群才渐渐散去。

    奥德修斯在这段时间里沐浴更衣，并抹上香膏。雅典娜使他神采奕奕，矫健
俊美，头上鬈发乌黑，看上去像神}一样。他回到大厅，坐在妻子对面。　　"
真是奇怪的女人哟，" 他说，" 一定是神}给了你一副铁石心肠。其他的女人，
当她看到丈夫受尽折磨重回故乡时，肯定不会这样固执地不认她的丈夫。" " 不
理解女人的男人哪，" 珀涅罗珀回答说，" 我不敢认你，既不是因为骄傲，也不
是因为轻视。我清楚地记得，二十年前奥德修斯离开伊塔刻时的样子。好吧，欧
律克勒阿，从卧室搬张床出来，铺上毛皮，让他就寝。" 　　珀涅罗珀这么说，
想试探一下她的丈夫。但奥德修斯却皱起了眉头，看着她说：" 你在侮辱我。我
的床没有一个人能搬得动。它是我自己建造的，这里有一个秘密。在我们建造宫
殿时，这地方中间有一棵橄榄树，粗大得像根柱子。我没有砍掉它，使这棵树正
好在我卧室里。等墙砌好后，我削去枝叶，留下树干，上面盖上天花板。后来，
我把树干磨得光洁，用它做了床的一根支柱，又安上雕着花纹、镶着金银和象牙
的床架，再用牛皮绳做成绷子。这就是我的床，珀涅罗珀！我不知道它是否还在
那里。可是我知道，如果有人想搬动它，就得把橄榄树齐根锯断。" 　　珀涅罗
珀听到他说出了只有他们两人才知道的秘密，激动得双腿发抖。她哭泣着从椅子
上站起来，朝丈夫奔去，一把抱住他的脖子，连连吻着他，说：" 奥德修斯哟，
你永远是个最聪明的人。请别生我的气！不朽的神}使我们遭受了多少苦难和厄
运，因为我们年轻时生活欢乐，过分幸福，使他妒嫉了，请你不要怪我，没有立
即温柔地投入你的怀抱，没有立即欢迎你。我的一颗可怜的心始终怀着戒备，担
心有一个假冒的人来骗我。现在，我完全相信了，因为你说出了只有你和我才知
道的秘密！" 奥德修斯高兴得心都在发颤，他也泪流满面，紧紧抱住可爱而忠贞
的妻子。　　这天晚上，夫妻两人互诉衷肠，各自谈起别后二十年的苦难。珀涅
罗珀直到她的丈夫把他的漂流故事说完，她才平静下来。两人上床就寝，屋里笼
罩着一片甜蜜温馨的气息。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事32：惩罚不忠的女仆们

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    奥德修斯看看四周，已经看不到一个活着的敌人了。他们都横七竖八地躺满
一地，就像渔夫从网里倒出来的鱼一样。奥德修斯吩咐他的儿子把老乳妈叫来。

    她进了大厅，看到主人站在尸体中间满身血污，两眼射出凶狠的目光，像一
头可怕的狮子一样，他的威严使她高兴得几乎哭起来。" 你应当欢喜，" 奥德修
斯对她说，" 但不要欢呼。凡人在死人面前是不能欢呼的！要他们死亡，这是神
}的决定。好吧，现在请你把宫中女仆们的情况告诉我，哪些人是不忠的，哪些
人是忠诚的。""宫中共有五十个女仆，" 欧律克勒阿回答说，" 她们中有十二人
背叛了你，既不听我的吩咐，也不听珀涅罗珀的吩咐。国王，现在让我叫醒熟睡
的女主人，把这好消息告诉她吧！""暂时别去惊动她，" 奥德修斯说，" 快去把
十二个不忠不义的女仆带到这儿来。" 　　欧律克勒阿照他的吩咐做了。十二个
女仆颤抖着走进来。奥德修斯把儿子和两名忠诚的仆人叫来，对他们说：" 让这
些女仆帮你们把死者扛出去。然后命令她们用海绵擦桌椅，把大厅打扫干净。当
她们做完这一切，就把她们押出去，用利剑杀死！" 　　女仆们吓得尖声哭叫，
挤作一团。奥德修斯逼着她们去干活。她们把死者抬出去，把桌椅擦干净，把地
上的血迹清除掉，把破烂什物扫出大厅。最后，她们被两个牧人带到厨房和宫殿
之间的空地上，使她们无路可逃。忒勒玛科斯说：" 这批女仆实在可恶，让她们
不得好死！" 　　说着，他把一根粗绳子系在一排柱子上，然后用绳索套住她们
的脖子，吊在粗绳上。她们挣扎了一会儿，便咽了气。最后，恶毒的牧羊人墨兰
透斯也被押过来，被乱刀砍死。复仇的事这时已经完成。　　接着，奥德修斯吩
咐欧律克勒阿，把碳火和硫磺放在平底锅里端进来，把大厅、内廷和前廷熏一遍。
但她却先给主人送来了披风和紧身衣，对他说：" 你不能再穿这身褴褛的衣服了。

    " 奥德修斯把衣服放在一边，要她快去做刚才吩咐的事。　　欧律克勒阿把
大厅和内廷熏了一遍后，又召来所有忠诚的女仆。她们流着欢乐的泪水，围着主
人，亲吻他的双手，奥德修斯也感动得流下了眼泪。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事31：向求婚人复仇

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    这时，奥德修斯捋起破衣袖，手中握着硬弓和装满箭矢的箭袋，站到高高的
门槛上。他把箭里的箭都倒在脚边，向求婚人大声地说：" 第一轮比赛已经结束，
现在进行第二轮比赛吧。这次由我选择目标！" 说着他拉起弓，搭上箭，瞄准正
在举杯喝酒的安提诺俄斯射去，正中他的咽喉，箭头从颈后穿出。他口鼻喷血，
酒杯也从手上滑落。他倒下时，把桌子撞翻了，菜肴和杯盘都洒在地上。求婚人
见他倒下了，都从椅子上跳起来，奔到墙边找武器，可是矛和盾都不见了。于是
他们破口大骂：" 该死的外乡人，你为什么瞄准我们射击！" 他们这样说，是以
为陌生人偶然射中了安提诺俄斯。他们不知道他们都面临着同样的命运。奥德修
斯对他们声震如雷地吼道：" 你们这些畜生，你们以为我永远不会从特洛伊回来
了！你们挥霍我的财产，诱骗我的女仆，并在我活着时就来向我的妻子求婚。你
们在神}和凡人面前都不感到羞耻！现在你们的末日已经到了！" 　　求婚人听
了大惊失色，各自寻找逃跑的路。只有求婚人欧律玛科斯强作镇定地说：" 如果
你真是奥德修斯，那么你就有权利向我们发怒，因为我们在你的宫中，在你的国
内，做了一些不该做的事情。可是，应该承担责任的罪魁已经死在你的箭下了。

    安提诺俄斯唆使我们干了这些事，他其实并不是真心向你的妻子求婚。他是
想当伊塔刻的国王，计划谋害你的儿子。他现在受到了应得的惩罚。我们是你的
同族兄弟，请宽恕我们。请你息怒！我们每人都给你补偿二十头肥牛，并送给你
所要的黄金和青铜，以求你的谅解！" 　　" 不！欧律玛科斯，" 奥德修斯严厉
地回答说，" 即使你们把所继承的遗产全部给我，我也不会甘休。我要你们以死
来抵偿你们的罪孽，任何人也休想逃出我的手掌！" 　　求婚人吓得心惊胆战，
瑟瑟发抖。欧律玛科斯又回过头来对朋友们说：" 这个人敬酒不吃，吃罚酒。大
家拔出剑来，用桌子挡住他的箭。我们必须制服他，把他推下门槛，然后我们去
请朋友来援助我们。" 说着，他抽出宝剑。可是，他还没来得及冲上去，飞箭已
射穿了他的胸部，利剑从他手中落到地上。欧律玛科斯痛苦地在地上翻滚，用头
撞着地面，不一会儿便死了。现在安菲诺摩斯挥剑向奥德修斯扑去，企图夺路而
逃。

    忒勒玛科斯持矛向他掷去，正中他的后背，他扑倒在地。忒勒玛科斯拔出长
矛，站到门槛上，与他的父亲站在一起，并给父亲递上一面盾牌，两根矛和一顶
铜盔。

    忒勒玛科斯又急忙奔进武器库，取来四块盾牌，四顶铜盔，八根矛，四顶有
马鬃盔饰的头盔。他和两个忠诚的牧人都武装起来。他们把第四套盔甲交给奥德
修斯。

    于是，四个人站在一起，并肩作战。　　奥德修斯箭无虚发，求婚人一个个
死在他的箭下。箭射完了，他把硬弓靠在门框上，用盾挡住身体，戴上头盔，盔
饰可怕地颤动着。他握着两根粗大的长矛，四下观察着。在大厅里有一扇边门，
通向内廷的过道。门很小，只容一个人通过。奥德修斯曾吩咐牧猪人欧迈俄斯看
守这门，但欧迈俄斯跑去武装自己时，求婚人阿革拉俄斯看到门口无人，便对同
伴们喊道：" 朋友们，我们快从边门进城搬救兵。只有这样，才能尽快把这个人
消灭！

    " 　　但站在一边的牧羊人墨兰透斯说：" 边门很小，过道很窄，每次只能
通过一人。他们四个人中只要有一个站在前面，就能把我们全杀掉。还是让我一
个人悄悄地钻出去，从他武器库里把武器搬来。" 说着他就这样做了。不久，他
搬来十二面盾牌、十二顶头盔和十二支长矛。奥德修斯突然看到对手们武装起来，
吃了一惊，回头对忒勒玛科斯说：" 这一定是不忠实的女仆或者是牧羊人干的事！

    " 　　" 阿，父亲，恐怕这是我的过失，" 忒勒玛科斯回答说，" 刚才我忙
着取武器，匆忙中忘记关门。" 牧猪人听到这话，急忙朝武器库奔去，准备关门。
他从开着的门里看到牧羊人正在里面拿武器，便赶紧回来报告。" 我是把他抓住，
还是把他杀了？" 他问主人。　　" 你同牧牛人一起去，把他抓住，把他的双手
和双脚反绑起来，吊在库房中间的梁柱上。然后把门关上，立刻回来。" 　　两
个牧人遵命而去。他们悄悄地走近牧羊人，把他抓住，按在地上，用绳子把他的
手脚反捆起来，再把一根长绳套在屋顶的钩子上，捆住他的身体，然后将他拉了
上去，吊在横梁边。随后，牧猪人和牧牛人关上门，仍然回到奥德修斯的身边。

    这时，又有第五个人来参战。这是变为门托尔的雅典娜，奥德修斯认出了女
神。求婚人看到这新来参战的人，非常愤怒。阿革拉俄斯怒冲冲地吼道：" 门托
尔，我警告你，不要上奥德修斯的当，来跟我们作对。否则，我们杀了你，烧掉
你的房子！" 雅典娜听了很生气，鼓动奥德修斯勇敢地对付求婚人。她说：" 你
好像不如在特洛伊战争中那样勇敢了。你用计谋征服了这座城市，可是现在，捍
卫你的宫殿和财产时，你怎么迟疑不前呢？" 她用这些话激励奥德修斯，是因为
她不想直接参加作战。说完话，她突然像只鸟儿一样飞上去，停在满是烟灰的横
梁上。" 门托尔走掉了，" 阿革拉俄斯对朋友们说，" 现在只剩下他们四个人了。

    让我们好好地想个对付他们的办法。你们不要把长矛同时掷出去，先掷六根，
集中瞄准奥德修斯！如果他倒下去，其他人便容易对付了！" 可是，雅典娜却让
他们的长矛掷偏了。一根中在门柱上，另一根砸在门板上，其他的则掷在墙上。

    奥德修斯对他的同伴们大声喊道：" 注意瞄准！" 四个人一起把长矛掷出去，
没有一根偏离目标。求婚人看到他们的同伴纷纷倒下，都退避到大厅的角落里。

    不一会，他们又大胆地从角落里冲了出来，从死者身上拔出长矛，继续投矛，
但大部分没有掷中。只有安菲诺摩斯的矛擦伤了忒勒玛科斯的手背；克忒西波斯
的矛在牧猪人的肩膀上划了一道口子。但他们两人反被忒勒玛科斯和牧猪人用长
矛掷中，倒地身亡。　　奥德修斯和他的朋友们从门槛上跳下来，向求婚人大肆
冲杀。勒伊俄得斯跪在奥德修斯的脚下，抱住他的双膝，苦苦哀求：" 可怜我吧！

    我没有对你家做过坏事，我一直劝阻他们，可是他们不听我的！我所做的只
是举行灌礼，难道这也有罪吗？" 　　" 如果你为他们举行灌礼，" 奥德修斯严
厉地说，" 那么你至少为他们的幸福作过祈祷！" 说着，他挥剑砍下了勒伊俄得
斯的头。　　歌手菲弥俄斯吓得面如土色，惊慌失措，不知道该从边门穿出去逃
命呢，还是该抱住奥德修斯的双膝求他饶命。最后，他还是选择了后者，将竖琴
放在地上，跪在奥德修斯的面前。" 请饶恕我吧！" 菲弥俄斯呼叫着，" 如果你
杀死一个用歌声娱乐神}和凡人的歌手，你会后悔的。我可以歌颂神}，也可以
歌颂你。

    你的儿子可以为我作证，是他们强迫我来唱歌的！" 奥德修斯举起宝剑，不
过他还在犹豫。这时忒勒玛科斯向他跑来，大声说：" 父亲，请住手！别伤害歌
手。

    他是无辜的。另外，如果使者墨冬还没有被杀死的话，我们也应该饶恕他。
他照顾我如同自己的孩子，对我们是很和善的。" 这时墨冬正裹着一张生牛皮躲
在椅子下。他听到有人为他求情，连忙钻出来，跪在忒勒玛科斯的面前。看到这
样子，奥德修斯也不禁笑起来，他说：" 歌手和使者，你们两人不用害怕了，忒
勒玛科斯已救了你们。出去告诉外面的人，忠心的人有好报，不忠的人该杀头。
" 两个人连忙逃出大厅，到了前廷，四脚仍然颤抖，只得坐了下来。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事30：奥德修斯向忠实的牧人表明身份

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    牧牛人和牧猪人走了出去，奥德修斯紧跟在他们后面。等到他们走出宫殿大
门和前院时，奥德修斯赶上他们，轻轻地对他们说：" 朋友们，如果我没有看错，
并可以信赖你们的话，我想告诉你们一些事情。否则，我宁愿沉默。首先我问你
们，如果神}突然让奥德修斯从外地归来，你们将站在哪一边？是站在求婚人一
边，还是站在奥德修斯一边？你们大胆地说心里话吧！" 　　" 呵，奥林匹斯圣
山上的宙斯哟，" 牧牛人大声说，如果神}能够实现这个愿望，让他归来，你将
会看到我要为他战斗！" 牧猪人欧迈俄斯也向神}祈祷，让奥德修斯平安回来，
以此作为对外乡人提问的回答。　　奥德修斯看到他们对自己的忠诚，便说："
那么，请你们听着：我就是奥德修斯！经过二十年，吃尽了辛苦，我回到故乡了。

    我发现，在成群的仆人中只有你们两人是忠诚的。因此，等我制服求婚人以
后，我将给你们重赏！让你们每人有一个妻子，一块土地，在我宫殿附近给你们
造一所房屋。将来，忒勒玛科斯会像亲兄弟一样看待你们。为了向你们证实我说
的是真话，我给你们露出我腿上的伤疤，那是我以前围猎时被野猪咬伤的。" 说
着，他撩起破烂的衣服，露出了那块大伤疤。　　两个牧人激动得哭了起来。他
们伸手拥抱主人，吻着他的两肩和面颊。奥德修斯也吻着两个忠诚的仆人，然后
叮嘱他们说：" 亲爱的朋友，千万要小心，不能让宫中的人知道我在这里！我们
必须一个个地走回去。今天，求婚人一定不会同意我参加比赛的。而你，欧迈俄
斯，大胆地把硬弓递到我手里。同时，吩咐女仆们把内廷的大门拴住。不管她们
听到大厅里有喧闹声还是呻吟声，都不准进来。而你，忠诚的菲罗提俄斯，则把
守宫殿的大门，将门闩好，用绳子捆紧。" 　　吩咐完毕，奥德修斯走回大厅。
一会儿，牧人也跟着进来了。欧律玛科斯正把弓放在火上烘烤，想使它松软。可
是，他仍然拉不开弓。欧律玛科斯十分沮丧，叹息着说：" 其实，不能得到珀涅
罗珀也无所谓，伊塔刻和其它地方有的是希腊女人。令人难堪的是，我们比起奥
德修斯来差多了，我们的子孙后代也会嘲笑我们的！" 　　安提诺俄斯斥责他的
朋友说：" 欧律玛科斯，别这样说。今天是阿波罗的节日，在节日是不宜张弓搭
箭进行比赛的。让我们推迟比赛，先去喝酒吧。把斧子都留在这里，我们明天再
来比赛。" 　　这时奥德修斯走上一步，面对求婚人说：" 你们今天休息也好，
明天也许会遇上好运，阿波罗也许会保佑你们取得胜利。同时我请求你们也让我
试试，看看我的可怜的身体里是否还有一点力量。" 　　" 外乡人，" 安提诺俄
斯叫起来，" 你是疯了，还是醉糊涂了？你也想参加比赛？" 　　珀涅罗珀打断
了他的话，温和而平静地说：" 安提诺俄斯，你也太过分了，排斥陌生人参加比
赛是不公平的！难道你们担心乞丐会张弓射中，并要求我作他的妻子吗？我不相
信他会这样想。你们不必这样担心。" 　　" 王后，我们并不担心，" 欧律玛科
斯回答说，" 不，不是这个意思！我们是说希腊人会说闲话，他们会说那些求婚
人都是废物，没有一个能够拉开奥德修斯的硬弓，得不到王后珀涅罗珀，最后，
倒被一个来自异乡的乞丐毫不费力地拉起硬弓，射中了十二把斧头的小孔。这不
是天大的笑话吗？" 　　这时，忒勒玛科斯对他母亲说：" 母亲，这张弓给还是
不给，宫中除了我，谁也不能作主。谁也不能阻止我把弓箭交给谁，我现在就把
它交给这个外乡人。至于你，母亲，最好进内廷去。射箭是男子的事。" 珀涅罗
珀听到儿子的话非常惊讶，但她还是顺从地退了进去。　　牧猪人把弓拿到手里，
求婚人愤怒地叫骂起来。他把弓递给乞丐，同时吩咐老女仆，将女仆都关在内廷。
菲罗提俄斯则奔到前廷，小心地闩上大门。　　奥德修斯仔细地检查这把熟悉的
硬弓，他要看看它在这么长的时间里是不是被虫蛀了，或有别的损坏。求婚人用
手肘推推身边的人，悄悄地说：" 看他的样子，好像懂得拉弓搭箭似的！" 　　
奥德修斯轻轻地拉了一下弓弦，试试它的张力。弓弦发出一种清脆的响声。求婚
人听到这声音都吓得脸都变了色。宙斯在天上发出雷鸣，作为一种吉兆。这时，
奥德修斯取出一支箭，搭在弓上，并拉开弓弦，用右眼瞄着，最后沉着地射去。
飞箭从第一把斧子的小孔穿进，从最后一把斧子的小孔中飞出。然后，他不动声
色地说：" 忒勒玛科斯，你接待的外乡人总算没有使你丢脸！看来，我的力量还
像当年一样。现在到了给这些阿开亚人开晚餐的时候了。趁天还未黑时，开晚餐
吧。

    我们还可以弹琴歌唱，为宾客娱乐！" 　　这是他跟忒勒玛科斯事先约定的
暗语。

    忒勒玛科斯立即佩剑执矛，穿着一身铠甲奔到父亲的面前。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事29：射箭比赛

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    珀涅罗珀也觉得现在是布置射箭比赛的时候了。她手中拿着一把带有象牙柄
的铜钥匙，由女仆们陪着，来到后库房，那是奥德修斯储藏财宝的地方。她看到
钉子上挂着一张硬弓和一个箭袋，便伸手把两样东西取了下来。他睹物思人，不
禁伤心地流下了眼泪。她让女仆拿着弓和箭袋离开了库房。珀涅罗珀一直走进大
厅，要求求婚人安静，然后对他们说：" 你们这些求婚人请听着，凡想得到我的
人，都必须作好准备，我们将举行一种比赛！这里有我丈夫的一张硬弓，那里依
次排着十二把斧头。不管谁，只要能拉弓一箭射过十二把斧头的穿孔，就可娶我
为妻，我也将随他同去。" 　　安提诺俄斯立即说：" 各位求婚人，来吧，让我
们进行这场比赛吧。当然，拉动这张硬弓，可不是一件容易的事。我们中间没有
一个人像奥德修斯那样健壮。" 他一边说，一边却幻想自己拉开弓，一箭穿过了
斧孔。　　这时，忒勒玛科斯站起来说：" 好吧，诸位求婚人，你们将要进行一
场在希腊尚无先例的比赛，为了得到全希腊最美丽的妇人。当然我不必再多费口
舌称赞我的母亲了。现在张弓射箭吧！我愿意参加比赛。如果我赢了，我的母亲
就可以永远留在家里了！" 说着，他丢下紫金披风，解下宝剑！在大厅的地上划
了一道小沟，把斧子依次插在地上，然后把土培上踩紧。他做完这一切，便拿起
硬弓，站在大厅的门槛上，连续拉了三次，但都失败了。他刚想拉第四次，父亲
对他使了一下眼色，他只得放下了硬弓。" 神}在上，" 他大声喊道，" 也许我
无力，也许我年轻，所以拉不动弓。现在轮到其他人了，你们比我有力，就来试
试吧！" 　　安提诺俄斯摆出一副得意的样子说：" 朋友们，那就开始吧！" 第
一个站起来的是勒伊俄得斯，他是唯一不满求婚人胡作非为的人，厌恶他们在餐
饮时放肆的吵闹。他从容地走近门槛，试着拉，但没有拉开。" 还是让别人来试
试吧，" 他大声说，" 我不是合适的人选！" 说完，他把弓和箭袋靠在门旁，两
只手却累得举不起来了。求婚人一个个地试着拉弓，但都失败了。　　最后，只
剩下安提诺俄斯和欧律玛科斯两人。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事28：宴　会

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    求婚人经过密谋，决定杀害忒勒玛科斯。这时他们来到大厅。宫中飘着一股
烤肉的香味，仆人们在调制美酒。牧猪人欧迈俄斯传送着酒杯；牧牛人菲罗提俄
斯分发篮子里的面包；牧羊人墨兰透斯给求婚人斟上美酒。于是，通常的饮宴开
始了。　　忒勒玛科斯故意让奥德修斯坐在大厅的门槛上，并在他的面前放上矮
凳和桌子。他叫人给他端来烤肉和满满的一杯酒，对他说：" 你安安静静地吃吧，
我不会让任何人来打扰你的。" 甚至连安提诺俄斯也警告他的朋友们，别去麻烦
这个外乡人，因为他觉得外乡人好像处处受到宙斯的保护。可是雅典娜却暗中怂
恿求婚人继续作恶，嘲弄他。从萨墨岛来的求婚人克忒西波斯仍然抑制不住要作
弄他。" 求婚人哟，请听我说，" 他带着讥讽的微笑说，" 这个外乡人已经得到
了他的一份，吃得很有味，如果忒勒玛科斯冷落这位高贵的客人，那就不合情理
了！不过我愿意赠给他一件珍贵的礼物！" 说着，他从锅里捞起一只猪蹄，朝乞
丐扔去。奥德修斯机灵地躲过了，蔑视地笑了笑，强忍住心中的怒火。扔来的猪
蹄滚落在墙脚下，地上沾了一摊油渍。　　忒勒玛科斯随即站起来，喊道：" 克
忒西波斯，幸亏你没有扔中这个外乡人，否则，我的长矛将戳穿你的胸膛。那时
你父亲为你举办的就不是婚礼，而是葬礼了。我在这里警告你们，不要在我的家
里干这种勾当！" 求婚人听了都默默无言。最后，阿革拉俄斯站起来说：" 忒勒
玛科斯说得对！但他和他的母亲也应该理智一点。如果奥德修斯还有回来的希望，
那么让我们这些求婚人等下去，还能让人理解。可是现在已经毫无疑问，他是永
远回不来了。忒勒玛科斯，请你劝你的母亲，从我们中间挑选一位最高贵的人作
她的丈夫，这样，你也可以继承父亲的遗产了！" 　　忒勒玛科斯从座位上站起
来说：" 我指着宙斯起誓，我也不想把这件事拖延下去。我早就劝母亲选定一位
求婚人。可是，她不愿意这样做，我当然不能把她从宫里赶走。" 求婚人听了这
话大笑起来，帕拉斯。雅典娜正在使他们头脑发昏，他们傻笑着，扮着鬼脸，把
半生不熟、鲜血淋漓的肥肉往嘴里塞。突然，他们的眼中充满了眼泪，顿时他们
由欢乐转为悲哀。预言家忒俄克吕摩诺斯看到这情景，惊讶地说：" 你们怎么啦？

    你们都昏昏沉沉，眼里充满泪水，口中吐着哀声！我看到墙上沾满了鲜血！
大厅和前院里游荡着地府的幽灵，天上的太阳熄灭了它的光辉！" 他这样说着，
但求婚人却疯狂地嘲笑他。　　欧律玛科斯对他们说：" 这个预言家待在我们这
儿时间还不长，他不过是个傻瓜。如果他在这儿看不到光明，那就让仆人们把他
赶出去吧。" 　　" 用不着仆人们赶，欧律玛科斯，" 预言家忒俄克吕摩诺斯说，
" 我自己离开这里。我的神智是清楚的，我已预见你们将遭到不幸和灾难，而且
没有一个人能逃脱厄运。" 说着，他就急速地离开了宫殿，到他先前的主人庇埃
俄斯那儿去了。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事27：从夜晚到天明

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    王后向外乡人道了晚安，便离开了。奥德修斯在女仆欧律克勒阿给他铺的床
褥上躺下。她用厚厚的羊皮铺在生牛皮上，又在奥德修斯躺下后在他身上盖了一
件长袍作被子。他在床上翻来覆去，久久不能入睡。轻浮的女仆们跟求婚人在嬉
闹，还不时从他的床前走过。奥德修斯强忍住怒火，自我安慰说：" 我的心啊，
忍着吧，你已经忍住许多苦难了！" 可是他仍然不能入睡，因为他在考虑复仇的
计划，他担心他们人多势众，制服不了他们。　　这时，雅典娜变成一个美丽的
姑娘，来到他的床前，俯下身子，对他说：" 你为什么这样沮丧而怯懦呢？一个
人可以依赖一个人间的朋友，何况我是一个女神呢。我曾经答应过保护你，现在
即使有天大的危险和艰难，我也会一如既往地保护你。你可以放心地睡了。" 说
着，她轻轻地触了一下奥德修斯的眼皮，使他安静地睡着了。　　清晨，宫殿里
又喧闹起来。女仆们过来生了火。忒勒玛科斯穿好衣服，赶赴市场召集国民大会。

    一群家犬跟在他的身后，欧律克勒阿吩咐女仆们准备献祭和宴会。求婚人带
来的男仆在院子里赶劈木柴。牧猪人送来了肥猪，并向他招待过的老朋友亲切问
好。

    牧羊人墨兰透斯也送来了肥羊，将它们拴在圆柱上。他经过奥德修斯的面前
时，嘲弄地说：" 老乞丐，你还赖着没有走？我想，你大概要尝到我的拳头才走
吧！

    " 奥德修斯只是摇摇头，一声未吭。　　现在，一个诚实的人走进宫殿，他
就是牧牛人菲罗提俄斯。他为求婚人送来一头牛和几只肥山羊。见了牧猪人，便
问他：" 欧迈俄斯，那个外乡人是谁啊？他很像我们的国王奥德修斯。" 说完，
他又朝奥德修斯走去，向他问候，说：" 外乡人，你好像很不幸，但愿你将来会
幸福！

    我刚看到你，就不由得流下了眼泪，因为你使我想起了奥德修斯，他现在也
许衣衫褴褛，在各地流浪，像个乞丐一样。我在年轻时就为他放牛。可是，现在
虽然牛羊成群，我却不得不把肥牛一头头地送给求婚人享用。我希望奥德修斯有
一天会回来，收拾这些无赖。不然的话，我也许早就离开伊塔刻到别处去了。"
" 牧牛人，" 奥德修斯说，" 看来你不是一个卑贱的人。我敢指着宙斯发誓，奥
德修斯今天就会回来。你将亲眼看到他是怎样惩罚这些求婚人的！" 　　" 但愿
宙斯保佑，使你的话能实现。" 牧牛人说，" 到时候，我决不会袖手旁观的！"

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事26：奥德修斯和忒勒玛科斯、珀涅罗珀在一起

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    现在大厅里只剩下奥德修斯和他的儿子。" 让我们赶快把这些武器藏起来，
" 父亲对儿子说。忒勒玛科斯叫来他的乳妈欧律克勒阿，吩咐她：" 老人家，让
女仆们都待在里面不要出来，直到我把这些武器搬走为止。" 　　" 好的，我的
孩子，" 欧律克勒阿回答说。　　父子两人立刻把头盔、盾牌和长矛扛进库房里。

    " 现在你去就寝。" 奥德修斯对儿子说，" 我在外面稍待一会，试探一下你
的母亲和女仆们。" 　　忒勒玛科斯离开了。这时珀涅罗珀来到大厅里，她美丽
娇艳，光彩夺人，如同阿耳忒弥斯和阿佛洛狄忒一样。她端过一张镶着白银和象
牙的椅子，放在火炉边，坐了下来。女仆们在桌上摆上面包和酒杯。珀涅罗珀对
奥德修斯说：" 外乡人，首先请你告诉我你的名字和你的身世。" 　　" 王后，
" 奥德修斯回答说，" 你什么都可以问我，只是不要问起我的身世和我的家乡。
我这一生遭受的苦难够多了，所以不想回忆往昔。" 　　珀涅罗珀接着说：" 外
乡人，自从我的丈夫外出后，我一直茹苦含辛，你也亲眼看到那些求婚人，如何
纠缠我。

    我已经用计回避他们三年了，可现在却不行了，我已经无法可想了。" 接着，
她把怎样设计织锦，后来女仆们怎样泄漏秘密等告诉了他。" 现在，我再也无法
推诿了。" 她最后说，" 我的父母催逼我，我的儿子也生了气，因为求婚人在挥
霍他该继承的家财。你可以想象我的处境了。所以，你不用再对我隐瞒你的家世
了。

    你毕竟不会是树木和山岩所生的儿子吧！" 　　" 既然你要我说，" 奥德修
斯回答道，" 那我就告诉你吧。" 于是，他把那个关于克里特的老故事说了一遍。
他说得那么逼真，珀涅罗珀听了感动得流下了眼泪。奥德修斯虽然很同情她，但
仍然抑制住内心的情感。　　" 外乡人，我想考你一下，" 珀涅罗珀说，" 看看
你是否真的在家里款待过我的丈夫。请告诉我，他当时穿什么衣服，他的样子怎
样，有谁和他在一起？" 　　" 因为时间太久，已经很难记得清了。" 奥德修斯
回答说，" 大英雄在我们克里特岛登陆，那是二十年前的事了。我好像记得他穿
一件紫金色的羊毛披风，上面一副金扣，绣着的图案是一只猎犬，前脚抓住一只
正在挣扎的野兽。外套的里面则是一件细白葛布的紧身衣。他的随从是个名叫欧
律巴特斯的使者，黝黑的脸膛，鬈头发。　　王后听了又淌下眼泪，因为这一切
都跟发生的情况相吻合。奥德修斯为了安慰她，又给她讲了一个半真实半虚构的
故事，他讲到在特里纳喀亚岛登陆，在淮阿喀亚人的国家里的生活。装作乞丐的
奥德修斯说这一切都是从忒斯普洛托斯人的国王那里听来的，在奥德修斯前往多
多那祈求神谕前，这国王曾在宫里招待过他，他还在那里留下了一大宗财物。乞
丐甚至说他亲眼看到过那宗财产，并深信奥德修斯不久会回到故乡。珀涅罗珀仍
不能相信他的话。" 我有一种感觉，" 她低着头说，" 你所说的这一切根本没有
发生过。

    " 说完，她吩咐女仆们给外乡人铺床洗脚，让他安寝。但奥德修斯不愿接受
这些不忠的女仆们侍候，他只想要一个草垫子。" 王后，如果你有一个忠心的老
女仆，" 他说，" 像我一样经历过许多苦难，那就让她给我洗脚吧。" 　　" 来
啊，欧律克勒阿，" 珀涅罗珀呼唤她的老女仆，" 是你亲自把奥德修斯养大的。
现在你去给这外乡人洗脚吧，他的年龄大概和你的主人一样大。" 　　" 好的。
" 欧律克勒阿看着乞丐，又说，" 瞧这双手，这双脚，就像奥德修斯的一样。一
个人在不幸之中总是容易衰老的！" 她说到这里禁不住流下泪来。当她准备为他
洗脚时，又仔细端量着面前的乞丐说：" 有许多外乡人到过这里，可是没有一个
人如你这样和奥德修斯相像的，你的身段、两脚和说话的声音跟我的主人奥德修
斯的一样。

    " 　　" 是啊，见过我们两人的人都这样说。" 奥德修斯随意回答了一句。
他看到老人舀来温水时，便连忙避开亮光，因为他不想让她看到右膝上的一块深
深的疤痕，那是年轻时他围猎野猪，被野猪獠牙咬伤后留下的。他担心被老人看
到认出他来。可是他虽然避开亮光，但老女仆还是用双手摸出来了。她惊喜得不
禁放开手，他的脚落到水盆里，溅起的水洒到地上。" 奥德修斯，我的孩子，这
是你啊。" 她喊道，" 我用手摸到你的伤疤了。" 奥德修斯急忙伸出右手捂住老
人的嘴巴，又用左手将她拉到身旁，小声地对她说：" 老人家，你想毁了我吗？
你说得不错，可是现在还不能说出真话，决不能让宫中的任何女仆知道这件事！
如果你不守口如瓶，你也会惨遭不幸的。""你说什么呀，孩子？" 女管家平静地
回答说，" 你难道还不相信我吗？但其他的女仆，你千万要提防啊！" 　　奥德
修斯洗过双脚，抹了香膏后，珀涅罗珀又跟他谈起来。她并不知道刚才的事，因
为女神让她专注地想着心事。" 善良的外乡人，" 她说，" 看来你是一个聪明的
人，请你给我圆一个梦吧。我在宫中养了二十只鹅，我喜欢看它们如何吞食用水
拌和的小麦。最近我做了一个梦，梦见山上飞来一只雄鹰，这只鹰咬断了二十只
鹅的脖子。它们都死了，躺在院子里，雄鹰却飞到空中。我开始大声地哭起来，
但梦还在继续。我看见来了一群妇女。她们安慰我，劝我不要烦恼。突然，那只
雄鹰又飞回来了，停在墙旁的窗台上，用人的声音对我说：' 别烦恼，伊卡里俄
斯的女儿，这是一种预兆，不是一个梦。求婚人就是这群鹅，而我这只鹰就是奥
德修斯。我回来结果了他们。' 听到这话，我突然醒了，立刻出去看我的鹅群。
我看见它们都在院子里争食。" 　　" 王后哟，" 乔装的乞丐回答说，" 奥德修
斯在你梦中的预言一定会实现。你的梦中幻景没有别的解释。他一定会回来的，
求婚人没有一个能活命。" 　　珀涅罗珀叹息着说：" 梦如同浮光掠影，而明天
就是一个可怕的日子，我要决定嫁给谁了。我将为求婚人举行一场比赛。以前我
的丈夫喜欢把十二把斧子依次排列，然后他从很远的地方一箭射去，穿过十二把
斧子的小孔。现在我决定：求婚人中谁能用奥德修斯的硬弓一箭穿过斧孔，我就
嫁给谁。""尊敬的王后，就这么办吧，" 奥德修斯说，" 明天一定要举行射箭比
赛！

    因为还没等到那些人张弓搭箭，一箭穿过十二把斧头的小孔，奥德修斯就回
来了。

    "

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事25：奥德修斯受讥讽

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    求婚人放肆地欢宴直到黄昏。天渐渐黑了下来，女佣们在厅堂里摆了三个火
盆，里面放了松木，点燃后供照明用。奥德修斯看到他们正在煽火，凑过去对她
们说：" 女佣们，你们应该上楼去陪伴仁慈的王后。大厅里点火照明的事交给我
来办吧！　　即使求婚人欢宴到天明，我也不会累倒的！" 　　女佣们相互看了
一眼，高声笑了起来。最后，一个漂亮而年轻的女仆梅兰托嘲弄地说：" 可怜的
乞丐啊，你不去找个地方过夜，却在这里对我们指手划脚，你不该待在这里，这
里都是高贵的人。你是喝醉了，还是发疯了？瞧你战胜了伊洛斯高兴的那副样子！

    你还是小心点，别让一个有力气的人把你打得口吐鲜血，然后被他拖出去。
" 梅兰托是由珀涅罗珀亲手抚养长大的，如同她的亲生女儿一般，现在却已成了
求婚人欧律玛科斯的情妇。　　" 你这无耻的小母狗，" 奥德修斯怒气冲冲地说，
" 我将把你说的这些话告诉忒勒玛科斯，他将严厉处罚你。" 女佣们听了都畏惧
地退了下去。奥德修斯坐在火盆边煽火，心里想着报仇的计划。雅典娜鼓动求婚
人继续嘲讽他。欧律玛科斯对他的同伴们说：" 这个人也许是神}给我们送来照
明的火炬。你们瞧他的头顶光秃秃的，连一根头发也没有，不是像火炬一样明亮
吗？

    " 他的话引起了哄堂大笑。他又转过身对奥德修斯说：" 听着，伙计！给我
当仆人怎么样？这样的话你就不会挨饿了。　　可是，我觉得你好像宁愿行乞也
不愿干活。" 　　" 欧律玛科斯，" 奥德修斯以坚定的声音回答说，" 但愿现在
是春天，我可以和你下地，比赛割草。那样就能看出谁更能吃苦耐劳了！也许你
更愿在战争中和我比试比试，看看我是怎样一个人。那样你就不敢再嘲笑我了。
你以为你是高大而强壮的人，这是因为你还没有碰到强手的缘故。等着吧，如果
奥德修斯真的回来了，你会尝到厉害的。" 　　欧律玛科斯勃然大怒。" 混蛋，
" 他大声叫道，" 我现在就叫你尝尝我的厉害。" 说着，他抓起一张矮凳朝奥德
修斯掷了过去。奥德修斯弯腰躲过，结果矮凳从他的头顶飞过，砸在后面端酒侍
者的手上，酒壶丁当一声掉在地上。　　求婚人都责骂这个外乡人破坏了他们的
欢乐情绪。最后，忒勒玛科斯有礼却又坚定地要求他们回去休息。这对安菲诺摩
斯站起来说：" 忒勒玛科斯说得有理。朋友们，让我们斟满金杯，举行灌礼，然
后各自回去就寝。"

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事24：珀涅罗珀和求婚人

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    现在，女神帕拉斯。雅典娜鼓起王后珀涅罗珀的勇气，使她决心来到求婚人
的面前，激起他们内心的热望，并在丈夫和儿子忒勒玛科斯的面前证实她的坚贞
和忠诚，虽然她还不知道那个乞丐是他的丈夫。　　忠心耿耿的老女仆赞成她的
决定。" 去吧，女儿，" 她说，" 站在你的儿子身旁，表明你的态度。可是你应
该先沐浴更衣，涂抹香膏。" 珀涅罗珀摇了摇头说：" 善良的老人，别强迫我干
这种事情！自从我的丈夫出发去特洛伊以后，我已经毫无兴趣打扮自己了。" 当
欧律克勒阿去叫侍女陪同王后出去时，雅典娜立即给珀涅罗珀催眠。乘她恬静入
睡之际，女神把她打扮得娇美动人，然后离去。两个侍女走进屋子时，珀涅罗珀
突然醒来，她揉了揉的双眼，从椅子上站起来，向大厅走去。当她悄悄地出
现在大厅的门口时，她媚人的容光从罩在头上的面纱里闪现出来，求婚人看到她
都不禁怦然心动，渴望得到这个美人，娶她为妻。王后却转过身子，走到儿子身
旁，对他说：" 忒勒玛科斯，你叫我感到奇怪。你小时候还比现在聪明一点！

    你为什么刚才在大厅里坐看一个外乡人和人决斗？他只是想在这里乞讨一点
食物，你怎么可以听凭他受人肆意侮辱？这多丢脸啊！" 　　" 母亲，" 忒勒玛
科斯回答说，" 我知道这是不对的，可是这些人和我作对，没有一个人支持我。
至于这个外乡人和伊洛斯的决斗，结果倒完全出乎求婚人的意料之外。但愿他们
不久也像门外那个可怜虫一样，都低下脑袋，威风扫地！" 忒勒玛科斯说话时声
音很低，求婚人都没有听到。欧律玛科斯看见美艳动人的王后，忘乎所以地叫喊
起来：" 伊卡里俄斯的女儿，如果全希腊的阿开亚人都能看到你，那么明天将会
有更多的求婚人上门了，因为你美丽的体态和容貌天下任何女人也比不上。""呵，
欧律玛科斯，" 珀涅罗珀回答说，" 自从我的丈夫和希腊人征讨特洛伊以来，我
的美貌就已经消失了！如果他回来了，我的生命之花就会重新开放！现在，我只
有悲哀。

    当他和我告别时，他握住我的手说：' 亲爱的妻子，希腊人不可能全部从特
洛伊生还的。特洛伊人是骁勇善战的，我不知道是否会活着回来。因此，务必请
你管理好家务，照顾好我的父母，就像你现在所做的一样。如果你的儿子长大成
人，而我仍然没有回来，那么，如果你愿意，也可以重新嫁人。' 他当时说了这
些话，现在一切都成为现实！可怜哪，可怕的结婚日子日益逼近，我多么害怕想
到这天啊，我多么盼望他能回来啊！因为这些求婚人完全不照通常的规矩办事，
天下哪有这样的求婚方式？如果一个男子想娶出身名门的女子为妻，那么得按风
俗，送上牛羊，赠给未婚妻珍贵的礼物，而不能随心所欲地挥霍别人的财产！"
　　奥德修斯听她说出这么贤慧睿智的话来，心里很高兴。但安提诺俄斯却代表
求婚人回答说：" 尊贵的王后，我们每一个人都想给你送上最珍贵的礼物，并请
求你接受！但我们希望你首先从我们中间先选定你的未来的丈夫，在这之前，我
们决不回去。" 求婚人纷纷点头，赞同他的意见。即刻他们派仆人回去，不久，
他们就捧来了大量的礼物。安提诺俄斯献给她一件美丽的彩服，上面钉着十二排
金钮扣和漂亮的玲珑剔透的金钩。欧律玛科斯送给他一串金链串着的宝石项链，
像太阳一样璀灿。欧律达玛斯捧出一副嵌着三颗珍珠的耳环。珀珊德洛斯送给她
一副精致的坠子。其他的求婚人也送给她珍贵的礼品。侍女们收下了这些礼物，
珀涅罗珀款款地离开了大厅，回到内廷。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事23：奥德修斯和乞丐伊洛斯

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    那些求婚人正在大厅里宴饮时，本地一个著名的乞丐走了进来。他一向以食
量大著称，虽身材高大，却软弱无力。他原名阿耳奈俄斯，因常常给人传递消息
赚取几个小钱，城里的年轻人便借用了神}的使者伊里斯的名字，称他为伊洛斯。

    他听说又来了一个乞丐夺他的地盘，便立即赶到宫殿的大厅里，想把奥德修
斯赶走。他说：" 老家伙，快滚开！否则我要动武了。" 　　奥德修斯恼怒地瞟
了他一眼说：" 你我都是乞丐，都可以在这里乞讨，你别赶我。我也不会赶你。
如果你要动武，我虽年老，但照样可以把你打得鼻青脸肿，叫你下次不敢到这里
胡闹。

    " 　　伊洛斯听了这话，勃然大怒，大声吼道：" 你太放肆了！瞧你这副鬼
样，我要把你牙齿打落，叫你尝尝我的厉害。我比你年轻，你敢和我决斗吗？"
求婚人听到两个乞丐争吵，都哄然大笑起来。安提诺俄斯说：" 朋友们，你们看
见那边火炉上烧烤着的血肠吗？我们愿意把这些作为两位高贵的英雄决斗的奖品
：胜利者可以尽情享受这些血肠，而且以后也只许他一个人到这大厅来！" 其他
的求婚人都赞同这个建议。但奥德修斯装得很可怜的样子，好像自己是个饱尝苦
难，毫无气力的老人。他要求婚人保证在决斗中不偏袒伊洛斯。求婚人都毫不迟
疑地答应了。忒勒玛科斯站起来说：" 我是主人，如果有人欺侮你，我就找他算
帐。" 求婚人都点头赞成。于是，奥德修斯束紧衣服，把衣袖向上卷了卷，这时
大家才看到他胳膊粗壮，肩膀宽阔，双腿强健，因为雅典娜暗中保护他，使他变
得更加高大强壮。求婚人惊讶地交头接耳：" 这老人多健壮呀，可怜的伊洛斯这
下够受的。" 伊洛斯早已吓得发颤，后悔向老人挑战了。安提诺俄斯生气地说：
" 吹牛的家伙，你怎能在一个软弱无力的老人面前发抖呢？你还算个人吗？

    我告诉你，如果你被打败，我就把你绑在我的海船上，送往厄庇洛斯的国王
厄刻托斯那儿去。他是个以残暴闻名的国王，曾把女儿的双眼戳瞎，人人见了他
都感到恐怖。他会把你的鼻子和耳朵割下来去喂狗！" 　　伊洛斯越发怕得浑身
哆嗦，但他们还是把他推到前面。于是，两个乞丐准备搏斗。奥德修斯在考虑是
一下子把这个可怜的乞丐打死，还是先轻轻地打他一下，以免引起求婚人的怀疑。
他觉得还是后一种办法比较明智。因此，当伊洛斯在他的右肩上打了一拳时，他
只是轻轻地朝伊洛斯的耳后击了一掌。尽管打得很轻，可是仍然打断了伊洛斯的
骨头，使他口吐鲜血，倒在地上。求婚人发出一片欢呼声和鼓掌声。奥德修斯把
伊洛斯拖到门外的庭院里，然后把他拉起来靠在墙上，在他的手上塞了一根讨饭
棒，嘲笑地说：" 你就呆在这里，看守猪狗，别让它们走近！" 说着，他走回大
厅，仍然坐在门槛上。　　奥德修斯获胜，使他赢得了求婚人的尊重。他们笑着
朝他走来，对他说：" 外乡人，你给我们除掉了这个可恶的家伙，但愿宙斯和其
他的神}保佑你，使你万事如意！" 奥德修斯把这话作为一个吉兆接受了。连安
提诺俄斯也亲自给他送来一大块羊肚，安菲诺摩斯从篮里取出两块面包送给他，
还斟满酒，向胜利者举杯。" 祝你幸福，老人，" 他说，" 愿你从此摆脱一切忧
愁和烦恼！" 　　奥德修斯严肃地看着他的眼睛，回答说：" 安菲诺摩斯，我认
为你是一个正直的青年，我知道你的父亲是一个有威望的人。请记住我的话：世
上最脆弱，最不稳定者莫过于人。当神}保佑他时，他便会勇往直前；当恶运临
近他时，他便会失去勇气，无力承受灾难。这是我从自身的经验中领悟到的。在
我年少气盛时，我做了许多不该做的事情。因此，我奉劝所有的人不要胡作为非，
应该敬畏神}. 我认为，求婚人如此蛮横，纠缠别人的妻子，这实在是不明智的。
我相信，她的丈夫已近在眼前了。安菲诺摩斯，但愿在他回来之前，神}引你离
开这里。" 　　奥德修斯说完，接过酒杯，先浇酒于地，然后一饮而尽，把酒杯
还给这个年轻人。年轻人沉思着，低下了头。可是，他仍然没有逃脱女神对他的
惩罚。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事22：乞丐奥德修斯来到大厅

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    忒勒玛科斯在宫殿里第一个看到了牧猪人进来，他招呼他过来。欧迈俄斯小
心地向四周看了看，然后，搬起一把椅子，坐在他的对面。这椅子是给求婚者切
肉的人在餐前坐的。使者看到牧猪人坐下了，便给他端上烤肉和面包。不一会儿，
乞丐奥德修斯也拄着棍子，踉踉跄跄地走进来，坐在门槛上。忒勒玛科斯一看见
他，便从篮里取出整块面包和一大块烤肉递给牧猪人，对他说：" 我的朋友，请
把这些给那个可怜的外乡人吧，请告诉他用不着害羞，可以直接到求婚人面前去
行乞！" 　　奥德修斯用双手接过面包和烤肉，很是感激。他把食品放在面前的
布袋上，开始吃了起来。宴会开始后，歌手菲弥俄斯给客人们唱歌助兴。后来，
他停下不唱了。大厅里充满了求婚人欢叙畅饮的声音。　　这时，女神雅典娜也
悄悄地走进来，没有人能看到她的身影。她劝奥德修斯向每个求婚人乞讨，以便
观察哪个最粗鲁，哪个较温和。虽然女神决定严厉地惩罚他们，但她想区别对待，
有的要死得得平缓一点，有的要死得悲惨一点。　　奥德修斯照她的吩咐去向求
婚人行乞。他伸出双手，真像一个老乞丐一样，向每个求婚人乞讨。有些求婚人
同情他，给他一点面包，并问他是从哪里来的。这时牧羊人墨兰透斯对他们说：
" 我曾经见过这个乞丐，他是牧猪人带来的！" 　　求婚人安提诺俄斯大怒，斥
责牧猪人说：" 你为什么把他带到这里来？难道我们这里流浪人还嫌不多吗？你
还要给我们多添一个吃饭的家伙吗？" 　　" 你真是狠心的人，" 牧猪人欧迈俄
斯大胆地说，" 大人物都把预言家、医生、建筑师和歌手招进宫，但没有人把乞
丐招进宫。他是自己进来的。但我们也不应该把他赶出去！再说，只要珀涅罗珀
和忒勒玛科斯还是这里的主人，就不会这样做的。" 　　忒勒玛科斯连忙阻止他
说下去，他说：" 欧迈俄斯，不要理睬他，你要知道，他这个人总是喜欢侮辱别
人的。安提诺俄斯，我要对你说：你并不是我的监护人，因此你没有权利把这个
乞丐赶出去。你最好施舍一些东西吧，用不着吝啬我的财产！但我知道你是个喜
欢独占独吞的人！" 　　" 你们看，这个年轻人在讥讽我！" 安提诺俄斯大叫起
来，" 如果每个求婚人都给这个乞丐一点东西，那就足够他享用三个月了！" 说
着，他抓起一张小板凳，盯着向他走来乞讨的奥德修斯，刻薄地说：" 讨厌的寄
生虫，听说你从埃及一直流浪到塞浦路斯，现在是哪位神}把你送到我的面前来
了？快滚开！否则我要把你再送回塞浦路斯或埃及去！" 　　奥德修斯忿忿地退
了下去，但安提诺俄斯却把小板凳朝他掷去，正好击中他的左肩。但奥德修斯却
像山岩一样挺立不动，只是默默地摇了摇头，回到门槛旁，放下装满食品的布袋，
对求婚人数落安提诺俄斯的行为。安提诺俄斯却大声制止他。" 闭上你的嘴巴，
像猪一样吃吧！否则，我会把你捆起来，拖出去！" 　　他的粗暴行为甚至使求
婚人也看不下去。其中的一个站起来说：" 安提诺俄斯，你朝一个不幸的外乡人
掷凳子，这是不对的。如果他是一个变形为乞丐的神}，你该怎么办？" 　　安
提诺俄斯根本听不进这个忠告。忒勒玛科斯看着别人欺侮他的父亲也一声不吭，
强忍住满腔怒火。　　王后珀涅罗珀正在内廷，从窗户里听到大厅里的吵闹声，
知道了发生的事情。她很同情这个乞丐，便把牧猪人叫来，悄悄地吩咐他把乞丐
带进来。" 也许，" 王后对他说，" 他会知道我丈夫的消息，因为他在世界各地
流浪过。" 　　" 是的，" 欧迈俄斯回答说，" 如果求婚人不吵闹，他也许可以
对他们讲许多事情。他在我那儿住了三天，说了许多故事，听起来真像歌手唱的
一样。他从克里特来，据说他父亲和你丈夫是世交。他还说，你的丈夫现在忒斯
普洛托斯人的地方，不久就会回来。" 　　" 那么，快去吧，" 珀涅罗珀感动地
说，" 把他带到这里来，让他亲自对我说！啊，这些求婚人真无礼！我们只是缺
少一个像奥德修斯这样的人。如果他在这里，忒勒玛科斯和他合作，就能对付这
些无耻的求婚人！" 　　欧迈俄斯把王后珀涅罗珀的意思告诉了乞丐，但他却回
答说：" 我很愿意把我所知道的关于奥德修斯的消息说给王后听，我知道他的许
多事，可是求婚人的行为把我吓住了。所以请告诉珀涅罗珀，请她现在忍耐一下，
等到晚上我再去把一切都告诉她。" 　　珀涅罗珀听到回话，认为有理，她决定
耐心等到晚上。　　欧迈俄斯仍然回到大厅，并悄悄地走到忒勒玛科斯身边，对
他耳语道：" 主人，我现在该回草屋去了。你在这里照料一切，只是我希望你注
意自己的安全。这些求婚人又狡猾，又狠毒，他们一心要谋害你。" 　　忒勒玛
科斯请他稍等，待用过晚餐再走。欧迈俄斯答应了。他离去时约定第二天再到城
里来给他送上最大的肥猪。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事21：忒勒玛科斯，奥德修斯和欧迈俄斯来到城里

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    当天晚上，牧猪人回到了草屋。这时，奥德修斯和他的儿子忒勒玛科斯正忙
着宰杀一只小猪，准备晚餐。因为奥德修斯又被雅典娜的金杖点过，重新变成了
衣衫褴褛的乞丐，所以牧猪人认不出他来。" 你从伊塔刻带来什么消息？" 忒勒
玛科斯大声问道，" 求婚人还埋伏在那里准备袭击我吗？" 欧迈俄斯告诉他，求
婚人的船已回来了。忒勒玛科斯偷偷地朝父亲笑了笑。　　于是，他们三人一起
用餐，餐后便躺下安睡。　　第二天早晨，忒勒玛科斯准备进城去，他对欧迈俄
斯说：" 老人家，我现在要去看望我的母亲。你把这位可怜的外乡人带到城里去，
让他可以在城里求乞，我无法接济每一个穷人，我自己的事已经够我烦恼的了。

    " 　　奥德修斯对儿子装假的本领感到惊奇而且满意，他说：" 亲爱的小伙
子，一个乞丐在城里求乞，总会比在乡下要有收获。你先走吧，让我先在火炉边
暖一暖身子，然后由你的仆人领我进城去。" 　　忒勒玛科斯急忙走了。他来到
宫门口，这时天色还早，求婚人还没有起床呢。他把长矛靠在门柱上，自己走进
大厅。

    女仆欧律克勒阿正忙着给王座铺上漂亮的坐垫。她一看见主人走进门，便含
着高兴的泪花朝他走去，欢迎他平安归来。其他的女仆们也围着他，连连地吻他
的双手。他的母亲珀涅罗珀也从内廷赶忙出来，苗条的身材就像阿耳忒弥斯，漂
亮的面容就像阿佛洛狄忒。她哭泣着拥抱儿子，吻着他的面颊。" 亲爱的儿子，
你终于回来了，" 珀涅罗珀呜咽着说，" 我真担心再也见不到你了，你为什么瞒
着我，偷偷地到皮洛斯去了？你打听到什么有关父亲的消息呢？" 　　" 啊，我
的母亲，" 忒勒玛科斯竭力忍住他的真实感情，悲愁地说，" 别提起父亲了，免
得我烦恼。

    你去沐浴更衣吧，然后向神}祈祷。如果他们答应保佑我们复仇，我们就向
他们举行隆重的祭礼。我现在到市场去接一位同我一起回来的外乡人，他正在一
位朋友那儿等我。" 　　珀涅罗珀照他说的那样做了。忒勒玛科斯手执长矛，向
市场走去，后面跟着几只猛犬。雅典娜使他神采奕奕，市民见了都惊羡不已。求
婚人也迎上来，对他说了许多恭维话，但心里却在暗暗地策划谋害他的计划。忒
勒玛科斯不理睬他们，只是同他父亲的三位老朋友门托尔、安提福斯和哈利忒耳
塞斯在一起，对他们讲了一些可以说的事情。现在，庇埃俄斯带着他的朋友忒俄
克吕摩诺斯走过来。忒勒玛科斯对两人表示欢迎。庇埃俄斯对他说：" 亲爱的忒
勒玛科斯，请你派女仆到我家去取墨涅拉俄斯送给你的礼物吧。" 　　" 好朋友，
" 忒勒玛科斯回答说，" 那些礼物暂时放在你家吧，这样更安全，因为我还不知
道事情将会怎样。如果求婚人把我杀死，他们会瓜分我的财产的。我与其把这些
珍贵的礼物送给他们，还不如送给你呢。如果我战胜了他们，你再把那些宝物还
给我吧！" 　　说完，忒勒玛科斯牵着预言家忒俄克吕摩诺斯的手，领他来到宫
殿。

    珀涅罗珀悲愁地对儿子说：" 忒勒玛科斯，我还是回内廷去，一个人呆着，
偷偷地流泪为好，因为你看来不会把听到的关于父亲的消息告诉我，是吗？" 　
　" 亲爱的母亲，" 忒勒玛科斯回答说，" 只要有一点能使你宽慰的消息，我一
定会乐意告诉你的。年老的涅斯托耳在皮洛斯热情地接待了我，可是他对父亲的
消息却一无所知。他派儿子和我一起去斯巴达。我在那里受到大英雄墨涅拉俄斯
的盛情款待，还见到了海伦。特洛伊人和希腊人为了她作出多大牺牲呵！我在那
里才听到一点消息。墨涅拉俄斯在埃及时听海神普洛托斯说，我的父亲在俄奇吉
亚岛被仙女卡吕普索强行留下了，他没有水手，也没有船，只好无可奈何地待在
那里。

    " 　　王后听到这消息，很激动，这时预言家忒俄克吕摩诺斯打断了年轻主
人的话，说道：" 王后，你的儿子并不知道全部情况，请听我的预言吧：奥德修
斯已经回到了家乡，他在等待机会，报复求婚人。那是一只飞鸟给我的预兆，当
时我就把这个吉兆告诉了你的儿子。" 　　" 但愿你的预言能够应验，" 珀涅罗
珀叹息着说，" 到时我不会忘记酬谢你的。" 　　这时，欧迈俄斯和他的客人也
出发到城里来。奥德修斯背着破口袋，手里拿着牧猪人给他的讨饭棍。他们来到
城里的一口水井边，突然遇到羊倌墨兰透斯和他的两个助手，他们正赶着几只肥
羊，给求婚人送去，让他们享用。羊倌看到牧猪人和衣衫褴褛的乞丐，便辱骂他
们：" 你们也在这里啊！真是物以类聚，人以群分，无赖领着无赖。该死的牧猪
人，你领着一个乞丐到哪里去呀？他想在城里沿门求乞吗？把他交给我吧，我可
以让他打扫羊圈，给羊喂草。这样，他还能派点用场！但是，他也许什么也不会，
那只好讨饭了！" 他一面说，一面朝奥德修斯的屁股上踢了一脚。奥德修斯突然
挨了一脚，但没有栽倒。他心里思量，是否要把对方打翻在地，但他还是忍住了。

    牧猪人欧迈俄斯却怒不可遏，严厉地斥责这个牧羊人，然后他转过脸去，对
着水井说：" 神圣的水泉女仙哟，如果我的主人以前向你们献祭过许多宝贵的礼
物，请容许我祈求你们，保佑我的主人平安地回来吧！他一定会惩罚这个无赖。

    他是世界上最恶劣的牧人，只知道整日在城里鬼混，是个游手好闲的家伙！
" " 你这个猪猡，" 墨兰透斯骂道，" 你只配卖到对面的岛上当奴隶。但愿阿波
罗的弓箭和求婚人的利剑杀掉你的忒勒玛科斯，使他跟奥德修斯一样下地府，因
为他是庇护你的人！" 他骂骂咧咧地从两人面前走了过去。到了宫殿，他坐到求
婚人的餐桌上，因为他是求婚人所宠爱的人，他们经常让他和他们一起用餐。

    奥德修斯和牧猪人也来到宫殿。这位大英雄看到久别的故居时，心里不由得
激动起来。他抓住同伴的手，对他说：" 天哪，欧迈俄斯，这里就是奥德修斯的
宫殿吧！多么华丽啊！多么坚固啊！里面一定在举行宴会吧，因为我闻到了肉的
香味！" 　　他们商量了一阵，决定由牧猪人先进去观察情况，奥德修斯则暂时
留在门外。这时，躺在门外的一条老狗突然站了起来，竖起耳朵。这条狗名叫阿
耳戈斯，是奥德修斯亲自喂养大的。以前，它经常随英雄外出打猎，现在老了，
无人看顾，只能伏在门外的垃圾堆上，身上肮脏不堪。它看到了奥德修斯，虽然
他变了模样，但仍然认出了主人。它向他垂下耳朵，摇着尾巴。可是它太衰弱了，
无力向他奔过来。奥德修斯看到这里，不由得偷偷地抹去眼泪，强忍悲痛，对牧
猪人说：" 这只狗年轻时该不会这样吧，看它的样子像是纯种的猎犬。" 　　"
是的，" 欧迈俄斯回答说，" 它是我那不幸的主人的爱犬，是一条顶呱呱的猎狗。

    可是现在主人不在了，狗也受欺侮。仆人们甚至不给它喂食！" 　　说着，
牧猪人走进宫殿。但这只狗认出了二十年前的主人，便把头伏在前爪上，心满意
足地死去了。

    载着忒勒玛科斯和他的同伴从皮洛斯归来的船已到达伊塔刻的港口。他们派
了一个使者前往宫殿，向珀涅罗珀报告儿子回来的消息。牧猪人也同时进宫报告
同样的消息。使者当着女仆的面大声对珀涅罗珀说：" 啊，王后，你的儿子已经
回来了。" 欧迈俄斯却乘周围无人时，悄悄地向她传达了年轻的主人吩咐的话。

    他还请她速派人把这消息告诉他的祖父拉厄耳忒斯。牧猪人办完事后，又急
忙赶了回去。求婚人从饶舌的女仆那里知道忒勒玛科斯回来了。他们怏怏地坐在
一起商量。欧律玛科斯首先说：" 想不到这个孩子能够顺利地回来。让我们速派
一条快船，通知埋伏在半路上的伙伴们，叫他们不要白等了，赶快回来。" 　　
当欧律玛科斯说话时，另一个求婚人安菲诺摩斯不在意地朝港口看了一眼，突然
看到求婚人出海伏击的船正乘风驶回了港口" 不用再去通知我们的朋友了，" 他
大声喊道，" 他们不是在那里吗？" 求婚人急忙站起来朝海岸走去。然后他们又
同那些回来的求婚人一起来到市场上，把留在那儿的市民赶走。这时，去伏击的
那帮求婚人的头子安提诺俄斯为自己辩护说：" 朋友们，忒勒玛科斯逃脱了，这
不是我们的过失。我们整天有人守候在岸边的山头上；晚上则驾船在海面上巡逻，
不让忒勒玛科斯滑过去。可是，一定是神}保护他，因为我们压根儿没有见到他
的船！现在我们只好在城内结果他，因为他羽毛渐丰，将来更难对付了。他必将
鼓动人民反对我们。如果他们知道我们在半路上伏击他，那么他们一定会把我们
赶出国门。我们还是先下手为强，把他干掉，把他的财产分光，只把宫殿留给他
的母亲和她未来的丈夫。如果你们不赞成我的计划，愿意留他一命，那么我们最
好不要再留在宫中享受，各自回家去，从家里给王后赠送礼物，向她求婚，让她
按照命运女神的安排挑选合意的人作她的丈夫。" 　　他说完后，求婚人沉默了
许久。最后，来自杜里其翁的尼索斯的儿子安菲诺摩斯站起来发言。他是求婚人
中最高贵的人。" 朋友们，我不想偷偷地杀害年轻的忒勒玛科斯！杀害一个王族
的最后一根独苗，毫无疑问，这是残忍的，卑鄙的。我们还是祈求神意吧。如果
宙斯同意我们这样做，我愿意亲自杀死忒勒玛科斯；如果神}不同意，那么我劝
你们放弃这个计划。" 　　安菲诺摩斯能言善辩，连王后珀涅罗珀也对他的聪明
和才智十分注意。他的意见得到求婚人的赞同，他们推迟了行动计划，回到宫殿。

    他们的使者墨冬又把听来的消息赶紧报告了王后。墨冬是王后珀涅罗珀安在
求婚人中的内线。珀涅罗珀想到这些伪善的求婚人这么狠毒，心里很痛苦。她回
到内廷，伏在床上放声大哭。她为自己的丈夫哭泣，直到女神雅典娜使她昏昏睡
去。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事19：奥德修斯对儿子表明身份

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    女神帕拉斯。雅典娜正等着欧迈俄斯离开草屋。他刚走，她便变为一个美丽
的女人站在门口，不过她只让奥德修斯和猛狗看到她。猛狗并不吠叫，只是低声
叫着跑到一边去了。女神向奥德修斯使了个眼色，他立即会意并走到门外。雅典
娜站在墙边，对他说：" 奥德修斯，你现在不必向儿子隐瞒自己了。你应该和他
一起进城去，我随后就来；因为我在心里也燃烧着一股怒火，很想惩罚这帮求婚
人！" 说着，女神用金杖在他身上点了点，即刻奇迹出现了，奥德修斯顿时变得
年轻高大，像以前一样。他面色光润，双颊饱满，头发和胡须浓密。随后女神消
失了。　　奥德修斯又回到草屋，他的儿子惊讶地注视着他，以为遇到了神}，
便虔诚地垂下头，说道：" 外乡人，你的模样突然变了。你一定是天上的神}！

    让我向你献祭，请你保护我们！""不，我不是神}，" 奥德修斯说，" 你该
认出我来，儿子，我是你的父亲！" 说着，奥德修斯流着泪跑上前去，拥抱儿子，
吻着他。忒勒玛科斯仍然不敢相信。" 不，不，" 他连连喊着，" 你不是我的父
亲奥德修斯！一定是凶恶的魔鬼在欺骗我，只是为了使我感到更失望。一个凡人
怎么能以自己的力量改变面貌呢？" 　　" 我真的是你的父亲，" 奥德修斯说，
" 我离家整整二十年，现在回到了故乡。我就是奥德修斯。是女神雅典娜先将我
变为乞丐，然后又恢复了我的原形。对神}来说，这是很容易的事。" 　　现在
儿子鼓起勇气含着热泪，拥抱父亲。后来，忒勒玛科斯问父亲是怎样回到家乡的。

    奥德修斯长叹一声，把途中的险遇都告诉了儿子。最后，他说：" 现在我到
了这里，我的儿子。女神雅典娜要我们商量一个办法，杀死那些无耻的求婚人。
你先把他们的名字告诉我，看看我们两人的力量是否可以对付他们，或者是不是
该到附近去寻求援兵。" 　　" 父亲，你光荣的伟业我早就听说过，" 忒勒玛科
斯回答说，" 我知道你有勇有谋，可是，我们两个人是无法对付这么多的求婚人
的。

    他们不是一二十人，他们的人比这多得多，光从杜里其翁就来了五十二个勇
敢的青年，他们带了六个仆人。从萨墨岛来了二十四个人；查契斯二十人；伊塔
刻十二人；此外，还有使者墨冬，一个歌手，两个厨师。因此，我们必须尽可能
地请求援兵。" 　　" 你别忘记，" 奥德修斯说，" 雅典娜和宙斯在援助我们。
我的计划是这样的：你明天进城去，跟求婚人在一起，装做什么事也没有发生的
样子。

    我仍然会变为一个老乞丐，由牧猪人领我进宫。不管他们在大厅里怎样侮辱
我，即使他们朝我掷东西，或者把我拖到门外，你都得竭力忍住。到关键的时候，
我给你使一个眼色，你就把大厅里的各种武器都搬走，藏到内廷去。如果求婚人
发现了，问起他们的武器和盔甲，你就告诉他们，武器都搬到外面去了，因为武
器离炉子太近，被烟熏黑了。不过，你要给我们两个留下两把利剑，两根长矛和
两面牛皮盾。别让任何人知道奥德修斯回来了，包括祖父拉厄耳忒斯和牧猪人，
甚至包括你的母亲珀涅罗珀。同时，我们要试探一下，看仆人中有谁还能忠诚地
站在我们这一边。" 　　" 亲爱的父亲，" 忒勒玛科斯回答说，" 我一定照你吩
咐的去做。可是我想，你要求试探仆人，这要化很多时间。宫中的女仆由我去考
验她们，其余散居在各处的男仆，等你重登王位后再去考验他们吧。" 　　奥德
修斯认为儿子说得有理，很赞成他的意见，并为他有主见而感到高兴。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事18：忒勒玛科斯回到伊塔刻

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    就在这天早晨，忒勒玛科斯回到了伊塔刻。遵照雅典娜的吩咐，他叫水手们
先进城去，自己则上岸去找牧猪人。他答应给水手们重赏，并在第二天设便宴招
待他们。　　" 我的孩子哟，" 忒俄克吕摩诺斯问忒勒玛科斯，" 城里有谁会留
我住下呢？我是否可以一直到你母亲的宫殿去？""如果家里情况很正常，我会请
你上宫殿去的。" 忒勒玛科斯说，" 可是现在求婚人会阻拦你，不让你进去。我
的母亲深居内宫，也不会出来。" 　　他们正说着，一只雄鹰从面前飞过，它的
利爪抓住一只鸽子。预言家忒俄克吕摩诺斯把忒勒玛科斯拉到一旁，凑近他的耳
朵，悄悄地说：" 孩子，如果我的观察不错，这便是你们家庭的一种吉兆。别的
人永远也不能统治伊塔刻。你们始终是这块土地的主人！" 　　忒勒玛科斯和忒
俄克吕摩诺斯分别前又为他介绍自己可靠的朋友克吕蒂沃斯的儿子庇埃俄斯，在
自己回城之前，由他接待这位预言家。　　说完，他挥手跟大家告别，步行到乡
下去。这时，奥德修斯和牧猪人正在草棚里准备早餐，别的牧人忙着把猪赶出去。

    他们刚坐下来用早餐，突然听到门外的脚步声和狗吠声，但不是狂吠，倒好
像是在迎接它们的主人。" 一定是个朋友或熟人来看你，" 奥德修斯对牧猪人说，
" 这些狗对陌生人不会是这样的。" 　　他的话刚说完，他就看见他的儿子忒勒
玛科斯站在门口了。牧猪人高兴得连忙放下杯子，朝他的年轻的主人迎上去，并
拥抱他，吻着他的手，眼泪也不禁淌下来，好像他的一个亲人死而复生一样。一
位年老的父亲看见他的晚生的儿子在外漂流十年重回故土，也不会比牧猪人更高
兴的。忒勒玛科斯没有马上进来，直到听仆人说家里没有发生什么事时，他才把
长矛交给牧猪人，走进草棚。　　奥德修斯正准备让坐，忒勒玛科斯连忙挥手阻
止他，并说：" 请坐下，外乡人，欧迈俄斯会给我准备位置的。" 　　这时，欧
迈俄斯用树叶和树枝给年轻的主人铺了一张柔软的座位，并在上面盖了一块羊皮。

    忒勒玛科斯坐了下来。牧猪人端上烤肉，递上面包，并用木碗斟上酒。三个
人坐着就餐时，忒勒玛科斯问迈勒俄斯，面前的外乡人是什么人。牧猪人把奥德
修斯自己编造的故事简单地说了一遍。" 现在，" 他结束时说，" 他已从忒斯普
洛托斯的船上逃了出来，来到这里，我把他交给你，随你去安排他。" 　　" 你
的话使我感到为难，" 忒勒玛科斯回答说，" 在目前的情况下，我怎么保护一个
外乡人呢？你还是把他留在这里吧。我将送给他紧身衣和长袍，还送给他一柄长
剑，足够的食品，使他不至于增加你和你的同伴的负担。但他决不能被求婚人看
见，因为那些人蛮横地待在我的家里，即使一个有权势的人也对付不了他们。"
奥德修斯，这个外地来的乞丐，却十分不理解。他奇怪地问，这些求婚人怎么敢
反对主人的儿子。" 是不是人民仇恨你，" 他接着问道，" 或者你和你的兄弟正
在内哄？或者你甘愿别人如此欺侮你？如果我像你一样年轻，而且是奥德修斯的
儿子，或者是奥德修斯本人，顺便说一句，奥德修斯是有希望回来的，那么，我
宁愿和他们拼命，死在自己的家中，也不愿屈辱地在一旁观望！" 　　忒勒玛科
斯冷静地说：" 亲爱的客人，人民并不恨我；我也没有兄弟，所以也没有兄弟间
的争夺，我是家中的独子。可是有许多心怀恶意的男人，从伊塔刻和附近的岛屿
涌来向我的母亲求婚。她一直回避他们，可是他们硬留下来，整日饮宴，赶也赶
不走。不久，我的家产就要被他们挥霍一空了。" 然后他转身对牧猪人说：" 你
是我的朋友，像慈父一样，请帮助我吧，请你进城给我的母亲捎个口信，告诉她，
我在这里。不过要小心，别让任何求婚人知道这件事。" 　　" 我是不是先绕道
去找你的祖父拉厄耳忒斯？" 欧迈俄斯问，" 自从你去了波洛斯，听说他焦急得
不吃不喝，十分悲伤。""尽管如此，" 忒勒玛科斯回答说，" 我也不愿你走太远
的路，这太费时间。我希望让母亲尽早知道我回来的消息！" 　　牧猪人立即穿
上鞋子，把鞋束紧，然后手执长矛，匆忙离去。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事17：和牧猪人的谈话

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    奥德修斯和牧猪人欧迈俄斯以及几个牧人一起用过晚餐。为了试探一下他的
东家愿意款待他多久，奥德修斯在饭后对欧迈俄斯说：" 我的朋友，为了不过多
地打扰你们，我想明天进城去行乞，并想去国王的宫殿，把我所知道的有关奥德
修斯的情况告诉他的妻子珀涅罗珀。当然，我也愿意为求婚人服务，说不定他们
会给我住宿和膳食。我会劈柴、生火、烤肉、端菜、斟酒等，会做一切穷人该做
的事。" 　　牧猪人听到这话，皱了皱眉头，回答说：" 你在想些什么呀！你想
去找死吗？你以为求婚人会要你这样的仆人吗？他们有的是仆人。年轻漂亮的仆
人，衣着整洁，来回在餐桌旁伺候他们，为他们端肉，送面包，斟酒。你最好还
是留在这里，等奥德修斯的儿子回来吧，他一定会给你衣食的！" 　　" 善良的
牧猪人，" 奥德修斯接着问道，" 你是哪里人，你是怎么进宫当差的呢？" 牧猪
人又给外乡人斟满酒，回答说：" 喝吧，老人，反正夜长着呢，我们有足够的时
间长谈，我们可以谈整整一夜。在俄耳堤癸亚每外有一座绪里亚岛，那里土地肥
沃，人口却不多。岛上有两座城市，由我的父亲克忒塞俄斯治理，他是俄耳墨诺
斯的儿子，是一位强大的国王。在我还是个孩子的时候，狡猾的腓尼基人在那里
上了岸，并运来许多漂亮的货物，在我们的岛上待了很久。这时，我们宫中有一
个买来为奴的腓尼基女子，长得苗条漂亮，手艺精巧，深得大家的喜欢。女人爱
上了一个腓尼基商人。这商人答应娶她，把她带回南方的家乡。这个坏良心的女
仆向他发誓，不仅要把我父亲宫中的黄金带走，作为路费，而且还要带走更宝贵
的东西。她对这个商人说：' 我是小王子的乳母，他十分聪明。无论办什么事，
他总是跟我在一起。我将把小王子骗到你的船上，把他卖了可以得不少钱呢。

    " 　　" 这个坏心肠的女人和他商量好后回到了宫殿，好像什么事也没有发
生似的。商人们在岛上住了整整一年。当他们正准备载着货物回去时，一个奸诈
的商人来到宫里，手里拿了一串金项链出售。我的母亲和仆人们围着观看，很是
喜欢，项链从一只手传到另一只手，并和他讨价还价。这时，这商人给那个女人
使了个眼色。他刚走，这个女人就牵着我的手走出来。经过前厅时，她看到准备
宴请客人的餐桌上摆着许多金杯，她连忙拿了三只金杯藏在衣服里。我看到这一
切，可是幼稚而又善良的我一点儿也不怀疑她，相反跟着她走出去。日落时，我
们到了海边上了船。我们在海上一路顺风航行了六天六夜。这个腓尼基的坏女人
突然中了阿耳忒弥斯的神箭，倒在船上死了。他们把她的尸体扔下大海。我孤苦
伶仃地留在船上，没有一个人愿意扶养我。经过长途旅行，他们来到了伊塔刻岛，
幸亏拉厄耳忒斯把我买了下来。" 　　奥德修斯听到拉厄耳忒斯的名字，便向牧
猪人打听他的近况。" 拉厄耳忒斯，这位老人还活着。" 欧迈俄斯说，" 他一直
想念奥德修斯，也深深地怀念妻子安提克勒亚。她因为思念儿子，最后忧伤而死。
我也为失去一位善良的女主人而悲痛。她把我跟她的女儿克提墨涅一起抚养长大，
待我如同亲生儿子一样。后来，她的女儿嫁到萨墨岛去了。安提克勒亚送给我许
多礼物，让我到这里做牧猪人的总管。当然，我现在很穷，只得自己养活自己。

    王后珀涅罗珀也无力帮助我，因为她被求婚人缠住了。一个仆人也无法去援
救他。

    " 　　奥德修斯听了深受感动，对他说：" 你不要过多地哀叹自己的命运。
愿宙斯赐福给你，把你交到一个善良人的手里，使你丰衣足食。现在你还能过平
静的生活，而我还一直漂流，回不了故乡。" 　　他们谈着谈着，不觉夜已深了。
他们睡了没多久，朝霞已映红了天边。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事16：忒勒玛科斯离开斯巴达

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    帕拉斯。雅典娜飞到斯巴达，在国王墨涅拉俄斯的宫殿里找到了从皮洛斯和
伊塔刻来的两个青年。他们已经躺下了。涅斯托耳的儿子珀西斯特拉托斯正在酣
睡。忒勒玛科斯却彻夜难眠，他在想念他的父亲。突然，他看到宙斯的女儿站在
自己的床前。" 忒勒玛科斯，" 女神对他说，" 你不能再远离故乡了，要知道，
求婚人正在你的宫殿里整日挥霍你的财产。你必须辞别国王墨涅拉俄斯，赶快回
伊塔刻去。否则，你的母亲就会被迫和求婚人结婚了。她的父亲和她的兄弟们正
在劝她嫁给欧律玛科斯。欧律玛科斯为了达到目的，不惜比别人献出更多的礼品，
而且，还答应在结婚时授予妻子更多的财富。你赶紧回去吧！不过要记住：求婚
人埋伏在伊塔刻和萨墨岛之间的海峡上，他们想要杀害你。你必须绕道而行，并
且只在黑夜里航行，神}会给你送上顺风。你到达伊塔刻岛时，让你的同伴们赶
快进城，而你则去寻找看管猪群的牧人欧迈俄斯，并在他那儿待到天明，然后派
人告诉你的母亲珀涅罗珀，说你已经平安地回来了！" 　　女神说完话就消失了。

    忒勒玛科斯立刻唤醒珀西斯特拉托斯，对他说：" 快起来，套上车，让我们
出发回去吧！""怎么了？" 涅斯托耳的儿子睡眼惺忪地问，" 现在深更半夜，等
到天亮再出发吧。说不定国王墨涅拉俄斯在告别时会送给我们许多厚礼呢。" 　
　他们正在商量出发的事，不觉天已亮了。墨涅拉俄斯起来得比两个青年更早。
忒勒玛科斯看到国王正在大厅里走动，便马上穿起紧身衣，披上披风，走了过来。
他请求国王允许他当天回乡。墨涅拉俄斯友好地回答说：" 亲爱的客人，如果你
回乡心切，我自然不便留你。请略等片刻，让我将送给你的礼物装上你们的马车。

    另外，我吩咐女仆为你们准备早餐。" 　　墨涅拉俄斯说完，命人赶紧准备
早饭。

    然后，他和王后海伦以及儿子墨伽彭忒斯来到库房。他挑出一只金杯，又让
儿子取来一把美丽的银壶。海伦从箱内找出一件她亲自织造的最漂亮的衣服。三
个人带着礼物向客人走来。墨涅拉俄斯送上金杯，墨伽彭忒斯献上银壶。海伦把
衣服塞在他的手里，说：" 亲爱的孩子，从海伦的手里接过这份礼物吧，作个纪
念。

    你的未婚妻将穿着它参加婚礼。在那一天到来之前，你把它保存在你的母亲
的箱子里。祝愿你幸福地回到你祖祖辈辈居住的地方。" 　　忒勒玛科斯收下这
些礼物，表示诚挚的感谢。他们用完送行的早餐，上了马车。墨涅拉俄斯右手端
着满满一杯酒，来到马前，向神}举行灌礼，祈祷神}让他们平安到家。忒勒玛
科斯再次表示感谢，他看到一头雄鹰从宫中飞来，鹰爪下抓着一只白鹅，一群男
女叫嚷着追了过来。雄鹰一直飞到两个青年的马前。看到这个吉兆大家都很高兴。
海伦还说：" 朋友们，请听我的预言吧！雄鹰抓到宫中的肥鹅，这表示奥德修斯
经过长久漂流后将以复仇者的身份回到家乡。也许他已经到了家乡，正准备收拾
那批养得肥肥的求婚人！" 　　" 但愿宙斯让这吉兆应验，" 忒勒玛科斯说，"
如果真的应验了，尊敬的王后，我将在家中像敬奉女神一样敬奉你。" 　　两个
青年告别后驾车出发了。第二天，他们平安地到达皮洛斯城。忒勒玛科斯请珀西
斯特拉托斯驾车绕城而行，直接把他送到海边的大船那儿，因为他怕朋友的父亲
又会盛情挽留。他们到了海边，珀西斯特拉托斯跟朋友依依惜别，对他说：" 快
上船出发吧！如果我的父亲知道你在这里，他一定会来挽留你在他的宫里住一夜。

    " 忒勒玛科斯的同伴们上了船，在船桨旁坐了下来。忒勒玛科斯则在船尾向
保护自己的女神雅典娜献祭，并祈祷。　　突然，一个人急急地朝他奔来，并伸
出双手，大声呼喊着：" 年轻人哟，凭着这些祭品，凭着神}，凭着你全家的幸
福，我请求得到你的庇护，让我登上你的大船吧。我是预言家忒俄克吕摩诺斯，
我的家在皮洛斯，从前生活在亚各斯。我在那里由于一时气愤打死了一个人。死
者的亲戚权势大，他们发誓要我偿命。我不得不到处流浪，现在他们追踪到这里，
恳求你让我上船吧。" 　　忒勒玛科斯非常同情他，便让他上船同行，并答应他，
到了伊塔刻也会照顾他的生活。忒勒玛科斯从他手里接过长矛，跟他一起坐在船
尾。水手解开缆绳，竖起桅杆，挂上白帆。顺风吹满船帆，船只飞快地航行在大
海上。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事15：奥德修斯和牧猪人

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    奥德修斯变成了乞丐，穿过茂密的山林和高地，来到女神指定的地点。他在
这里果然找到了牧猪人欧迈俄斯，这是他的一个忠心的仆人。欧迈俄斯正在山坡
上用巨石围成的牧场上牧猪。这里共有十二个猪圈，每圈有五十头母猪。公猪的
头数明显少于母猪，它们都在圈外。宫殿里的求婚人每天都要宰杀一头肥猪，因
此只剩下三百六十头了。此外还有四条猛犬看守猪群，它们看上去凶暴得像恶狼
一样。　　牧猪人正在切牛皮，准备做绊鞋。他的三个助手赶着猪去放牧了，第
四个进城给横蛮的求婚人送猪去了。只有他一人留在那里。　　那些狗发现了奥
德修斯，吠叫着扑了过来。奥德修斯丢掉棍子坐在地上。如果不是牧猪人及时从
门内赶出来，用石头把狗赶走，奥德修斯肯定要被自家的狗咬伤了。牧猪人转向
他的主人，不过他以为眼前的外乡人是个乞丐，便对他说：" 老人家，我要来晚
点，你就会被狗咬了。进屋来吧，可怜的外乡人，我给你一点吃的，等你吃饱喝
足后，你再告诉我，你从哪里来，受到哪些折磨。你显得实在可怜！" 　　他们
进了草房。牧猪人给他在地上铺了些树叶和树枝，又在上面垫了一张粗陋的野羊
皮，然后请他坐在羊皮上。奥德修斯感谢牧猪人的好意。欧迈俄斯听了，回答说
：" 老人家，我们一点也不能亏待客人。当然，我没有什么财产，不能好好招待
你。如果我的主人在家，我的情况一定要好一些。他会赐给我房屋、田地和妻子。

    那样，我就能慷慨地款待外乡的朋友了！" 　　说完，牧猪人走进满是猪仔
的猪圈。他抓了两只，把它们杀掉，准备招待客人。他把肉切成片，穿在铁叉上，
撒上面粉，放在火上烤得喷香，递给奥德修斯。他又把罐里的甜酒倒在木碗内，
放在外乡人的面前，说：" 吃吧，外乡人，请尽情地享用，这是小猪仔肉，大肥
猪都被无耻的求婚人吃光了。他们一定听说我的主人已经死去，所以他们前来向
他的妻子求婚，全不依照平常的规矩，而是放肆地挥霍他的财物。他们每天不是
宰一、两次猪羊，而是日夜饮宴，在宫中喝光了一桶又一桶的美酒。啊，我的主
人的财富有二十个君主的财产那样多！他有十二群牛，十二群绵羊、山羊和猪仔，
都由他的牧人在草地上放牧。这儿就有十一群山羊，由忠实的仆人们看守着，但
他们每天必须给求婚人送上一头肥羊。我放牧他的猪群，可是每天也必须挑选一
头肥猪，送给那批贪得无厌的求婚人！" 　　牧人说话时，奥德修斯不停地大吃
大喝，一句话也没说。他心里却在动着复仇的念头。当他吃饱喝足后，牧人又给
他斟上一杯美酒，他为牧人祝福，然后说：" 亲爱的朋友，给我更详细地讲一讲
你的主人的情况吧！我也许认识他，也许在什么地方见过他，因为我算得上是个
走遍天下的人！" 　　牧猪人不相信地摇摇头，回答说：" 你以为，一个外乡人
给我们讲一点有关主人的事，我们就会相信吗？过去，已有不少的外乡客，为了
寻求衣食和住宿，讲了不少关于主人的情况，王后和她的儿子听了感动得流泪。

    但我认为他们都是来骗吃骗喝的，我相信，他一定不在人世了。我再也不会
有这样善良的主人了。当我想起奥德修斯的时候，我就觉得是在想念一位仁慈的
长兄，而不是我的主人。" 　　" 噢，我亲爱的朋友，" 奥德修斯回答说，" 尽
管你在心里不相信他会回来，可是我却要对你发誓：奥德修斯一定能回来。我要
在他回来后，才会向你们要求报酬，要求你们送我衣衫。我虽然贫穷，但我绝不
会说谎。

    我恨死了说谎的无赖。你听着，我当着宙斯的面，指着你的餐桌和奥德修斯
的牧群向你发誓：在今年年底以前，他一定会回到他的宫殿，并收拾那批骚扰他
的妻子和儿子的求婚人。" 　　" 呵，老人家，" 欧迈俄斯回答说，" 你安静地
喝酒吧，别再胡说了。你的预言得不到我的报酬，因为我的主人奥德修斯不会回
来了。

    我现在只担心他的儿子忒勒玛科斯。我希望他的聪明才智跟他父亲的一样。
可是有人，也许是一个神}使他失去了理智，他到皮洛斯去打听父亲的消息了。
求婚人却乘机埋伏在半路上，准备把古老的阿耳喀西俄斯家族的最后一棵根苗除
掉。

    现在请告诉我，你是谁，你为什么事来到伊塔刻？" 　　奥德修斯给牧猪人
编造了一段故事，说他是没落的富家子弟，家住克里特岛，然后又编了一些离奇
的冒险经历。他在故事中提到了特洛伊战争，说在那里认识了奥德修斯。他说在
回家途中风浪使他漂到忒斯普洛托斯人的海岸，那里的国王对他讲奥德修斯曾在
忒斯普洛托斯作客，后来他到多多那的神坛祈求宙斯的神谕去了。　　当他说完
编造的故事后，牧猪人说：" 不幸的外乡人哪，你的不幸的遭遇，使我深受感动，
可是关于奥德修斯的事，我却不能相信。你何必凭空编造呢？几年前，一个埃陀
利亚人路经这里，对我说，他在克里特岛的国王伊多墨纽斯那儿看到奥德修斯，
说奥德修斯正在修理被风浪打坏的船。他还说奥德修斯在夏天，至迟在秋天，一
定会带着他的同伴和丰富的战利品回到家乡。他说这些谎话，只是为了让我收留
他。

    从那以后，凡是说见过我主人的话，我都不相信。你不用说谎了，你不说谎，
我也会招待你的。" 　　不一会，他的助手们都赶着猪回来了。老牧人吩咐宰杀
一头五岁大的肥猪，招待客人。他用一部分猪肉献祭仙女和神}赫耳墨斯，并把
另一部分猪肉分给他的助手，可是他却把最好的肉献给客人，尽管这位客人在他
的眼中不过是一个乞丐而已。　　奥德修斯深受感动，他感激地喊道：" 友好的
欧迈俄斯哟，我如此潦倒地站在你的面前，你却如此尊敬我，愿宙斯保佑你。"
牧猪人感谢他的好意，并劝他用膳。　　他们正在欢乐地吃喝时，乌云遮住了月
亮，西风在空中呼啸。随即大雨瓢泼而下。奥德修斯因衣衫褴褛，感到寒冷，不
由得紧紧裹住衣衫。　　欧迈俄斯见状连忙起身，在离火坑不远的地方给客人铺
了一张床，床上铺了厚厚的山羊皮和绵羊皮，他让奥德修斯躺下，还给奥德修斯
盖上一件厚厚的长袍。自己执着长矛在猪圈旁过夜，看守猪仔。奥德修斯暗自庆
幸有这样一位忠心的仆人，他即使认为主人已经死了，仍小心地为主人看守家财。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事14：奥德修斯回到伊塔刻

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    奥德修斯睡得又沉又香。大船飞快而平稳地在海面上航行。当晨星显耀在天
空时，船已经朝伊塔刻岛驶去，不久，就进入了平静的港湾。这里是祭奉海神福
耳基斯的圣地。港湾中间的岸上长着一棵古老的橄榄树，树旁有一座幽暗的山洞，
这是海洋女神们的住所。洞里有许多石罐石坛，这是蜜蜂储蜜的地方。一旁还有
几架织机。仙女们用紫线织出美丽的衣裳。山洞里涌出两股永不枯竭的泉水。山
洞有南北两个进口：北边有一个门，让凡人进出；南边有一个隐蔽的门，让仙女
们进出。淮阿喀亚人在山洞附近上岸。他们把奥德修斯连人带床抬到洞前树下的
沙地上，并把国王阿尔喀诺俄斯和其他王子们赠送的礼物都放在稍远的不使人注
意的地方，免得路过的行人乘主人熟睡时偷去。他们不敢把奥德修斯唤醒，因为
他们相信熟睡是神}们送给奥德修斯的礼物。他们悄悄地告别了他，又上了船，
划桨向家乡驶去。　　海神波塞冬对淮阿喀亚人在帕拉斯。雅典娜的帮助下胆敢
夺走他的猎物非常恼怒。他向万神之父宙斯要求报复淮阿喀亚人。宙斯同意了。

    当船只来到舍利亚岛正向故乡驶去时，波塞冬突然从波浪中跳出来，朝着大
船猛击一掌，然后又沉入海底。顿时，船只和船上的一切都变成了石头，像生了
根似的停在那里。淮阿喀亚人正在岸边迎接，他们看到这情景都大吃一惊。　　
国王阿尔喀诺俄斯听说了这件事，叹息了一声，说：" 天哪，我曾听我父亲说起
一个古老的预言，它今天终于应验了。父亲对我说，因为我们善于航海，可以把
任何外乡人平安地送回自己的故乡，所以波塞冬心里对我们很恼恨。将来有一天，
一条淮阿喀亚人的船，在送客回来的途中会变成石头，像一座小山似地耸立在我
们的城外。以后，我们不能再把寻求保护的外乡人送回去了。现在，我们应该宰
杀十二头公牛，献祭愤怒的海神波塞冬。我们向他祈祷，请他原谅我们，在以后
别把我们的船只都变成小山，并用这些坚固的小山包围我们的城市。" 淮阿喀亚
人听到这话，心里都很害怕，他们赶忙去准备祭品，向海神献祭。　　同时，奥
德修斯在伊塔刻的海滩上醒了过来。他离家太久，已经认不出这块地方了。况且，
帕拉斯。雅典娜降下浓雾，将他团团围住，她不愿意让他冒冒失失地回到他的宫
殿里去，因为求婚人在他的宫殿里仍在胡作非为。奥德修斯坐起来，用拳头敲敲
自己的额头，痛苦地叫起来：" 我是多么不幸啊，又到了一个陌生的国家。我在
这里又遇到什么新的怪物呢？我要是留在淮阿喀亚，和淮阿喀亚人生活在一起，
该多好啊！他们是那么友好，但现在他们好像也骗了我。他们答应把我送回伊塔
刻，却把我扔在这块陌生的地方。但愿宙斯惩罚他们。他们一定也偷去了我的礼
物！" 　　奥德修斯向四周张望，他看到铜三脚鼎、大锅、黄金和衣服都整齐地
堆放在那里。奥德修斯点了一遍，发现什么也没有少。他沉思着在海滩上徘徊。

    女神雅典娜变形为一个牧人，朝他走来。他友好地问他，这是什么地方。"
你一定是从远方回来的人，因为你还不知道这是什么国家。" 女神说，" 告诉你
吧，这是世界有名的海岛。它叫伊塔刻！" 　　奥德修斯听到他日思夜想的祖国
的名字，心里多高兴啊！可是他仍然很留神，没有对牧人说出自己的名字。他假
装说，他带了一半财物从克里特岛过来，另一半的财产留在那里给了儿子们。他
还编造说，克里特岛的强盗企图抢劫他的财产，他不得已才逃了出来。他说完他
的故事，帕拉斯。雅典娜微微一笑，爱抚地摸了摸他的脸颊，突然变成了一个高
大而美丽的年轻姑娘。" 的确，" 她温柔地说，" 你是一个狡黠的人，即使神}
要胜过你，也必须极其精明才行！你回到了自己的祖国，却仍然不说真话，我们
不谈这些了；如果说你是凡人中最聪明的，那么我就是神}中最明智的。你还没
有认出我，而且还不知道正是我帮助你度过了种种难关，并使你受到淮阿喀亚人
的友好接待。

    我现在特地赶来，想帮助你隐藏这些财物，并要告诉你，你回宫后必将遇到
的困难和考验。" 　　奥德修斯听了大吃一惊，他抬起头，仰望着女神，回答说
：" 你是尊敬的宙斯的女儿，你可以变换成各种模样，一个凡人怎能认出你来？
自从特洛伊陷落后，我还一直没有看到你的真身。现在，请求你告诉我：我真的
回到了可爱的祖国吗？你不是在安慰我吗？" 　　" 你用自己的眼睛去看吧！"
雅典娜说，" 你看，这不是福耳基斯海湾，那不是橄榄树吗？你不是曾经在前面
的仙女洞里献祭了不少的祭品吗？这长满高大树木的涅里同山，你也许没有忘记
吧？

    " 雅典娜一面说，一面拂去他眼前的层层迷雾，使他清楚地看到家乡的山水。
奥德修斯兴奋地伏在地上，吻着大地，并向保护地方的仙女们祈祷。雅典娜帮他
把带回来的礼物藏在山洞里，并在一切藏匿停当后，推来一块巨石拦住洞口。接
着，他和雅典娜坐在橄榄树下，商量回宫后对付和消灭求婚人的办法。雅典娜对
他说出了求婚人的无耻行径，并称赞他妻子的贤惠和忠贞。　　" 天哪，" 奥德
修斯听到这事后，望着苍天大叫一声，" 仁慈的女神，如果你没有把这一切都告
诉我，那我回家以后一定会像回到迈肯尼的阿伽门农一样惨遭杀死。如果你愿意
援助我，即使我面临三百个敌人也不会害怕。" 　　女神听了微微一笑，回答说
：" 请放心，我的朋友，我绝不会离开你。现在，我首先要让岛上的任何人都认
不出你来。

    你魁梧的身材必须缩小，炯炯有神的目光必须变得黯淡，头上棕色的头发全
部脱落。我让你穿上褴褛的衣服。这样，你不仅在求婚人面前，即使在你的妻子
和儿子面前也只是一个又老又丑的外乡客。你第一个要找的是你的忠实的仆人，
他现在是牧猪人，在阿瑞图萨山泉附近的柯拉克斯山麓牧猪，你要坐到他的身旁，
向他打听家中所发生的一切事情。我利用这段时间赶到斯巴达去，召回你的儿子
忒勒玛科斯，因为他到墨涅拉俄斯国王那儿打听你的消息去了。" 　　女神说完，
用她的神杖轻触奥德修斯，他的肌体顿时收缩干枯，成了一个衣着褴褛的乞丐。

    女神给他一根棍子和一个背在肩上的破口袋。然后她就隐去了。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事13：奥德修斯告别淮阿喀亚人

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    第二天早晨，淮阿喀亚人把赠送的礼物送到船上。阿尔喀诺俄斯把礼物小心
地放在水手的座位下面，免得它们妨碍水手摇桨。最后，国王在宫中举行了盛大
的告别宴会。他们先给宙斯献祭，然后宾主开怀畅饮。盲人歌手特摩多科斯唱起
他最美的赞歌。　　奥德修斯心不在焉，他凝望着窗外洒满阳光的海滩，渴望早
点启程。最后，他直截了当地对国王说：" 尊敬的阿尔喀诺俄斯哟，请祭酒在地，
让我离去吧！一切都已准备好了。礼品已放到我的船上，船可以启航了。愿神}
们降福于你，愿神}们保佑我平安到家，见到我的妻子、儿子和朋友！" 　　淮
阿喀亚人衷心地为他祝福。阿尔喀诺俄斯吩咐使者蓬托诺俄斯最后一次为客人们
斟满美酒，每个人都感激地站起来，为奥林匹斯圣山上的神}们浇酒献祭。这时，
奥德修斯向王后阿瑞忒举起酒杯，说道：" 再见了，高贵的王后！祝你健康长寿！

    愿你为你的孩子、你的人民和你的英雄的丈夫而高兴！" 　　奥德修斯说完
便走出了宫殿。一份使者和三名女仆按国王和王后的吩咐送他上船。一个为他拿
着美丽的长袍、披风和紧身衣；另一个扛着箱子；第三个端着洒食。这些东西都
送到船上。奥德修斯默默地登上船，静静地躺下睡了。水手们也坐在各自的位置
上。

    最后解缆启锚，船随着船桨有力的击水声欢快地前进。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事12：塞壬女仙，斯策拉和卡律布狄斯，太阳神的
牛群

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    我们在埃埃厄岛火化并且安葬了埃尔朋诺耳的尸体，然后给他建了一座坟。

    喀耳刻依然对我们以礼相待，并为我们准备了充足的食品。临行时，她警告
我们途中有险。　　途中第一个险遇发生在塞壬（Siren ）女仙们居住的海岛上。
她们专门以美妙的歌喉迷惑航海的人。她们坐在绿色的海岸上，看见船只驶过，
就唱起动听的魔歌。被歌声吸引而想登陆的人总是遭到死亡。因此，这儿的海岸
上尸骨成堆，显得恐怖而阴森。我们的船在女妖海岛旁突然停了下来，因为吹动
我们前进的顺风突然停息了。海面平静如镜。我的朋友们放下船帆，将它们卷起
来，开始摇桨前进。这时，我想起了喀耳刻的预言，她说：" 当你经过塞壬女仙
居住的海岛时，女仙们会用歌声引诱你们，你必须用蜡把朋友们的耳朵塞起来，
不让他们听到歌声。如果你自己想听听她们的歌声，你就叫朋友们先把你的手脚
捆住，绑在桅杆上。你越是请求他们放下，他们就得把你捆得越紧。" 　　我马
上割下一块蜂蜡，将它揉软，然后把它塞住我的朋友们的耳朵。他们也照我的吩
咐，把我捆在桅杆上，然后又用力摇桨。塞壬女仙们看到船只摇近，都变作媚人
的美女，来到海岸上用甜蜜而清脆的嗓音唱道：　　来呀，奥德修斯，荣耀的希
腊人，请停下来，倾听我们的歌声！　　没有一只船能驶过美丽的塞壬岛，　　
除非舵手倾听我们美妙的歌声。　　优美的歌给你们快乐与智慧，　　伴随你们
平安地航海前进。　　塞壬女仙完全知道在特洛伊的原野，　　神}使双方的英
雄备尝生活的艰辛。　　我们的睿智如普照天下的日月，　　深知人间发生的战
争与爱情。　　我听着，听着，突然心里产生了一股抑制不住的愿望，想奔到那
儿去。

    我用头向朋友们示意，请他们放开我。朋友们什么也听不到，只是用力地摇
桨前进。其中有两位朋友，欧律罗科斯和珀里墨得斯牢记我的吩咐，他们走过来，
把我捆得更紧。直到我们平安地驶过塞壬岛，完全听不见她们的歌声了，朋友们
才取出耳中的蜡条，并把我从桅杆上解下来。我很感谢他们毫不动摇地前进，摆
脱了塞壬女仙的引诱。　　我们继续前进。不久，我看到前方水花迸溅，波涛汹
涌。

    这里就是卡律布狄斯大漩涡。它每天三次从悬崖下奔涌而出，并在退落时将
通过的任何船只全都吞没。我的朋友们吓得连手上的桨都掉在水里，差点被波浪
卷没。

    船停了下来。这时，我从坐位上站起来，走到船头，给我的朋友们鼓气。"
朋友们，" 我说，" 今天我们遇到的危险不会超过我们在库克罗普斯的山洞里所
遇到的危险，当时我们也从那里逃出来了。现在，你们不要慌，听我的吩咐，都
坐在原位，抓紧桨，勇敢地朝漩涡冲去。我想，宙斯一定会帮助我们的。而你，
掌舵的朋友，更应小心，拿出本领来，操纵我们的船靠岩边航行，不要被卷进漩
涡里！

    " 喀耳刻曾经对我讲起过卡律布狄斯大漩涡，我再三提醒朋友们注意。但喀
耳刻还提醒我提防海妖斯策拉，为了不致引起朋友们的恐慌，我对他们没有提及。
只是我却忘了喀耳刻提醒我的事：在跟海妖搏斗时不要穿铠甲。可是我仍然穿上
铠甲，手持两根长矛，站在船头，准备迎头痛击冒出水面的海妖。我不知道海妖
从哪里出来，于是便小心地四处观察。我们的船渐渐地逼近隘口。我想起喀耳刻
向我描述过斯策拉的模样。她说：" 她不是可以杀死的海妖，而是不可杀死的海
妖。

    光凭力量和勇敢是制服不了她的。唯一的办法就是避开她。她住在卡律布狄
斯大漩涡对面的山岩上，山峰高耸入云，山腰有一个阴暗的山洞，那是太阳永远
也照不到的地方。她就住在这里。她的可怕的叫声如同狗吠，一直飘到很远的地
方。

    海妖有十二只不规则的脚，有六个蛇一样的脖子，每个脖子上各有一颗可怕
的头，张着血盆大口，露出三排毒牙，随时准备把猎物咬碎。她把她的一半身子
潜伏在山洞里，而把六个头伸出洞外，吞吃海豹、海豚和其他海里的大动物。还
从来没有一艘船经过这里时不被她攫去几个水手的。" 　　我正想着这怪物的模
样，船已接近卡律布狄斯大漩涡，它真像火炉上的一锅沸水，波浪翻腾，激起漫
天雪白的水花。当潮退时，海水混浊，涛声如雷，惊天动地。这时，下面黑暗的
泥泞的岩穴便可一眼见到。当我们惊恐地注视着这一可怕的景象时，当舵手正小
心地驾船往左绕过漩涡时，突然海怪斯策拉出现在我们面前，她一口就叼去了我
们的六个同伴。我看见他们在妖怪的牙齿中间扭动着双手和双脚，挣扎了一会儿，
他们便被嚼碎，成了血肉模糊的一团。　　我们终于穿过了卡律布狄斯大漩涡和
海妖斯策拉之间的危险的隘口。现在，船航行在平静的海面上。特里纳喀亚岛出
现在我们的眼前。岛上阳光明媚，生意盎然。那里传来神牛的哞哞叫声和绵羊的
咩咩声，它们是太阳神的牧群。不幸和灾难使我们变得聪明多了。我想起了喀耳
刻和提瑞西阿斯的警告，便连忙吩咐同伴们避开太阳神的海岛，但我的同伴们听
到这话却很不高兴。欧律罗科斯恼怒地说：" 奥德修斯，你是一个狠心的人。我
们已经精疲力竭了，你难道真忍心不让我们休息一下吗？不让我们上岛去吃一顿，
喝一口吗？难道我们必须整夜在漆黑的海上航行吗？如果夜晚巨风突然袭击我们，
我们该怎么办？就让我们在岸上过一夜吧！瞧这里的海岸多么可爱，多么迷人！

    " 　　我的意见遭到他们强烈的反对，我知道一定有一个和我敌对的神}想
要毁灭我们。于是，我只得说：" 欧律罗科斯，你们不该逼我上岸。我是唯一反
对上岸的人。不过，我可以对你们让步。只是你们先得庄严发誓，决不可宰杀太
阳神的一头牛，一只羊。你们只能吃喀耳刻送给我们的食品！" 他们都愿意发誓。
于是，我们便驾船驶入海湾。这是河流的入海处。我们离船上海岛，并用了晚餐。

    用完餐，我们又想起被海妖斯策拉吞掉的六个同伴，心里都很悲痛，禁不住
流下泪来。后来我们都因疲劳不堪，倒地睡着了。　　后半夜时，宙斯突然吹起
一阵可怕的飓风。天亮时，我们很快把船驶到山岩下避风。我知道天气骤变定有
缘故，便再次警告同伴们，千万不能杀害太阳神的牛羊。出乎我们的意料之外，
这次大风使我们在那里逗留了足足一个月。海面上有时刮南风，有时刮东风。东
风和南风对我们都是不利的。同时，我们还面临着一种威胁：喀耳刻送给我们的
食品渐渐吃完了，我们开始挨饿了。这时同伴们只好捉鱼捕鸟，用来充饥，我忍
不住顺着海岸走去，希望能遇到一个神}或凡人能为我们解难。我在远离朋友们
的地方找了块浅滩，走近海边，把双手伸进海水里洗干净，以便伸出一双洁净的
手向神}祈祷。我虔诚地伏在地上，祈求神}给我们一条生路。但神}却使我昏
昏沉沉，进入梦乡。　　当我不在时，欧律罗科斯向我的朋友们提了一个极危险
的建议。

    " 朋友们，你们听着，" 他说，" 死有各种各样的死，但活活饿死是最难受
的。

    我们为什么不去杀几头牛，把最好的肉献祭神}，而把剩下的肉用来填饱我
们的肚子呢？我们将来回到伊塔刻时再给太阳神建造一座漂亮的神庙，请他宽恕。
如果他真的恼恨我们，要给我们降下风暴，使我们沉船落水，那么好吧，我宁愿
在海里淹死，也不愿活活饿死。" 　　饥肠辘辘的同伴们听到这话都很高兴。他
们即刻从太阳神的牧群中选了几头肥牛，把它们赶过来，并对神}祈祷，然后将
牛杀死，把牛油裹着内脏的牛肉献给神}. 因为船上的酒早已喝完了，他们只好
用清水代替酒浇在祭品上，给神}举行灌礼。他们把剩下的一大堆牛肉穿在铁叉
上烧烤，这时，他们围成一团，撕着牛肉，吃得津津有味。我醒了，在远处就闻
到牛肉的香味。我大吃一惊，仰望苍天，大声呼喊着：" 万神之父宙斯哟，你为
什么让我睡着了？我的朋友们犯了何等的罪孽啊！" 　　太阳神听说了在他的圣
地上所发生的事后，恼怒地来到奥林匹斯圣山，向神}们申述这件亵渎神灵的罪
孽。

    太阳神威胁说，如果偷牛的罪人们得不到惩罚，他就把太阳车赶到地府去照
耀死人，永远不给大地送去光明。宙斯愤怒地从神位上站了起来。" 赫利俄斯，
你还是用阳光照耀神}和凡人吧！" 他说，" 我将用雷霆把他们的船击得粉碎，
使它沉入海底。" 这些话是高贵的女神卡吕普索事后告诉我的，她是从神}的使
者赫耳墨斯那里听来的。　　我回到船边，见到我的朋友们，把他们狠狠地责备
了一顿，但这一切都已经晚了，神牛已被杀死，牛肉堆放在我的面前。可怕的预
兆表明他们犯了大罪：剥下的牛皮自己走动，就好像活着一样；在铁叉上的烤牛
肉哞哞鸣叫，跟活牛的鸣叫一样。可是，我的那些饿昏了头的同伴们仍然不顾这
些预兆，他们大吃大嚼，整整六天，到了第七天，风势减弱，他们登上船，向大
海航行。海岸渐渐看不见了，最后完全看不见了。这时，宙斯在我们头上堆起重
重乌云，海水也变得越来越黑。突然吹来强劲的西风，船桅上的两根缆绳断裂了，
桅杆轰然倒下，舵手当场被砸死，天空中又射来一道闪电，轰击船只，空中充满
硫磺烟火的气味。我的朋友们都跌落水中，在波浪中挣扎，最后被波浪吞没了。
船上只剩下我一人，在甲板上徘徊。船的两舷裂开，并脱落了，飘到水里。残破
的船体像片树叶在波浪中翻滚。但我还没有失去理智，我顺手抓住荡在桅杆上的
皮绳，把桅杆和船体捆结实，做成一只小舢板。我坐在上面，随着波浪颠簸漂荡。

    暴风终于平息了。海面上吹起阵阵南风，这使我又产生了新的恐惧，因为我
又会被吹进斯策拉的岩洞和卡律布狄斯大漩涡里去。这事果真发生了：拂晓时，
我看到斯策拉的岩洞和可怕的卡律布狄斯大漩涡。我还没有来得及思考，船就被
卷进漩涡里，只有桅杆顶留在水面上。我连忙抓住悬岩上的一棵下垂的无花果树
的树枝，像蝙蝠一样吊在空中。当我看到桅杆和船体做成的舢舨又从漩涡里冒上
来时，马上落到舢舨上，用双手当船桨，拼命划动，离开了大漩涡。天哪，要不
是宙斯开恩，把我的舢舨从海妖斯策拉的岩洞旁引开，让我安全渡过隘口，我早
就成了海妖的美餐了。　　我在茫茫的大海里漂了九天九夜。在第十天夜里，神
}们可怜我，把我推上俄奇吉亚岛。这里是高贵而威严的女神卡吕普索居住的地
方。她收留了我。　　哦，尊敬的国王，最后这件事，昨天，我已经对你和王后
说过了，我就不赘述了。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事11：在阴间

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    太阳落进了大海，一阵大风把我们送到世界的尽头――奇墨里埃人的海岸。

    这里终年浓雾，是阳光永远也照不到的地方。我们按照喀耳刻的吩咐，来到
两条黑河的汇合处的山岩前。然后，我们献祭。当羊血刚从切开的喉咙里流入我
们掘开的土坑时，死者的幽魂就从岩缝里涌出来，男女老少都有，还有许多战死
的英雄们，带着伤口，披着血染的战袍。他们成群结队，大声呻吟，在祭供的土
坑上面飘荡。我非常惊恐，但很快我便依照喀耳刻的吩咐命令同伴们焚烧祭羊，
并祈求神}保护。我抽出宝剑，把幽灵赶开，在提瑞西阿斯的灵魂出现之前，不
让他们舐食羊血。　　但这时我的朋友埃尔朋诺尔的幽灵却出现在我的面前；他
的遗体还躺在喀耳刻的宫殿里没有安葬。他含着泪水向我悲诉他的厄运，请我回
到埃埃厄岛的时候将他隆重埋葬。我答应了他的请求，于是，他就坐在我的对面。
我们就这样伤心地坐着交谈，一边是埃尔朋诺耳的幽灵，一边是手握宝剑，不让
幽灵舐食祭品鲜血的我。不一会，我的母亲安提克勒亚的灵魂也来到我的面前。
当年我出发远征特洛伊时，她还健在。看到她时，我不由得失声痛哭。可是我仍
然守护着祭品，不让她走近舐血。　　提瑞西阿斯的灵魂终于出现了，右手拄着
一根金杖，他立刻认出了我，对我说：" 尊贵的拉厄耳忒斯的儿子，你怎么离开
了阳间，来到了令人恐怖的阴间？请把宝剑从土坑上移开，让我喝一口祭供的鲜
血，然后我告诉你未来的事情。" 听到这话，我往后退了一步，把剑推入剑鞘。
他俯下身，舐着黑色的羊血，然后说道：" 奥德修斯，你希望我告诉你回归祖国
的可喜消息。可是有一个神}在阻拦你，你不能逃脱他的手掌。这是海神波塞冬。
你曾经深深地得罪过他，把他的儿子波吕斐摩斯的眼睛戳瞎。因此，你的归程不
会平安。但你不必失望，最后你仍能回到故土。你首先在特里纳喀亚岛登陆。如
果你不动太阳神养在那里的圣牛和圣羊，你就能平安回家。如果你伤害它们，你
的船和你的朋友就会遭殃。即使你一个人侥幸逃出，也要孤独可怜地过上许多年
才能由外乡人的海船载回故乡。你回家后，仍然悲愁和烦恼，因为骄横的男人在
挥霍你的财产，向你的妻子珀涅罗珀求婚。你将用计谋或武力杀掉他们。不久，
你又得漂流，来到一个地方。那里的人不知道大海，不知道船只，也不知道在食
物中放盐调味。在那个遥远的国家里，有人会奇怪地问你为什么在肩上扛一把木
铲。

    这时，你就把船桨插在地上，并向海神波塞冬献祭，请求海神谅解。你把航
海知识传给异国的民族，这时海神将会息怒。然后，你重新回家。你的王国从此
繁荣昌盛，你也可以活到老年，在一个离开大海很远的地方离开世间。" 　　这
就是他对我的预言。我感谢他，并问：" 瞧，我的母亲的幽灵坐在那里，可是她
默默无言，也不看我一眼。请告诉我，我该怎样使她认出自己的儿子呢？" 　　
" 让她喝些祭供的鲜血，她就会开口说话了。" 提瑞西阿斯回答说。说完，他的
阴魂消失在黑暗的阴间王国里。我的母亲的阴魂走近我，并吮吸鲜血。突然，他
认出我来，流着泪对我说：" 亲爱的儿子，你怎么活生生地来到这死人的王国？
你从特洛伊回国一直在海上漂流吗？" 我们情况详细地告诉了她，然后问她怎么
死的，并打听家中的情况。她回答说：" 你的妻子仍在家中，坚贞不渝地等你回
去。她日日夜夜地为你流泪。你的儿子忒勒玛科斯管理着你的财产。你的父亲拉
厄耳忒斯在乡下居住，不愿到城里去。整个冬天，他像仆人似地躺在炉边的稻草
上，衣衫褴褛，生活很苦；夏天，他露宿野外，躺在树叶上，他是因为悲叹你的
命运才过这种生活的。我的可爱的儿子，我也是因为想念你而死的。" 　　我听
了深受感动，张开双臂，想去拥抱母亲，可是她像梦中的幻影一样消失了。现在
许多阴魂涌过来，全是著名英雄的妻子。她们都吮吸祭品的鲜血，向我诉说各自
的命运。

    她们的幻影也消失了。我抬起头来，看到了令我激动的幻影。那是大统帅阿
伽门农的阴魂。他慢慢地走近土坑，吮吸鲜血。然后，他抬起头，认出了我，悲
痛得哭了起来。他朝我伸出双手，但无法够到我。我急忙问起他的情况。" 尊贵
的奥德修斯哟，" 他说，" 也许你以为是海神把我淹死的，其实不是如此。我妻
子克吕泰涅斯特拉和她的情人埃癸斯托斯乘我沐浴时谋杀了我，在我怀着对妻儿
的想念之情从远方归来时被他们杀害了。为此，我也劝你，奥德修斯，千万要小
心，不要太相信自己的妻子，不要因为她的热情而把秘密都告诉她。但是我忘了
你的妻子是聪明而贤淑的！尽管如此，我仍然劝你悄悄地返回伊塔刻，因为能够
完全相信的女人几乎是没有的啊！" 　　说完这些晦涩的话，他就转身消失了。
接着，阿喀琉斯和他的朋友帕特洛克罗斯的阴魂来到我的面前，后面跟着安提罗
科斯和大英雄埃阿斯。阿喀琉斯先俯下身去吮吸鲜血，他认出了我，觉得很奇怪。
我对他说明了到这儿来的原因，并说他生前像神}一般受人尊重，死后也一定是
伟大的阴魂，过得幸福。他听了忧伤地回答说：" 奥德修斯哟，不要对死者说安
慰话了！我宁愿在人间当奴仆，也不愿在阴间当君王。" 我忍住悲伤，对他讲起
他的儿子涅俄普托勒摩斯的英雄业绩。他听了满意地离开了。　　其他死者的阴
魂吸了鲜血后都和我交谈，只有埃阿斯除外。我在特洛伊城前与他争夺阿喀琉斯
的武器，我赢了，他因此自杀，所以他对我很痛恨，冷冷地站在一边。我温和地
对他说：" 忒拉蒙的儿子哟，你难道到了地府还不能忘掉我们的争斗吗？这是命
运女神的安排啊。因此，高贵的王子，请你跟我说话吧！" 可是他仍然默默无言，
转身消失在黑暗中。　　我看见那些死去的英雄的幽灵都涌到我的身边，突然感
到害怕了。我赶紧和我的同伴们离开了裂口，朝我们的大船走去。于是，我先履
行对埃尔朋诺尔的诺言，启锚扬帆朝喀耳刻居住的海岛驶去。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事10：埃洛斯的风袋，莱斯特律戈涅斯人，喀耳刻

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    后来，我们来到希波忒斯的儿子埃洛斯居住的海岛。他是神}的好友。这座
岛像是浮在海上一样，周围铜墙环绕，砌在陆地边缘的陡峭的山岩上。埃洛斯在
岛上建造了一座宫殿。他有六个儿子，六个女儿，每天和妻子儿女饮宴作乐。这
位好心的国王招待我们在岛上住了足足一个月。他饶有兴趣地向我们打听关于特
洛伊城、希腊英雄和他们返乡的情况。我详细地回答了他的问题。最后，我恳请
他帮助我们回国，他也一口答应了，并赠给我鼓鼓的皮袋。这是用九岁老牛皮制
成的，里面装着各种各样的风，都是可以吹遍世界的大风，因为宙斯让他掌管各
类风，他有权叫风儿吹起，或停息。他亲自用银绳把风袋捆在我们的船上，把袋
口扎紧，不让一点儿风漏出来。但是他没有把所有的风都装进去，当我们出发时，
西风轻轻吹起船帆，送我们回乡。如果不是我们的冒失和愚蠢，我们本可平安地
回家的。　　我们在海上航行了九天九夜。到了第十天的晚上，我们已经来到家
乡伊塔刻岛的附近，连岛上燃烧着的烽火也看得清清楚楚。偏偏在这时，我由于
连日劳累，不禁睡着了。乘我睡着时，我的同伴们纷纷猜测埃洛斯国王送给我的
皮袋内装着什么礼物。他们一致认为袋里一定是金银珠宝。一个心怀妒嫉的人自
言自语地说：" 这个奥德修斯无论到哪里都受到重视和尊敬！看看他一个人从特
洛伊带回多少战利品啊！可我们呢，我们一样冒险和吃苦，却落得两手空空。埃
洛斯这次又送给他满满一口袋金银财宝。怎么样，让我们看看里面到底有多少？

    " 其他人听了他的建议都赞成。他们刚解开袋口，所有的风都呼啸而出，将
我们的船又吹进波浪汹涌的大海上。　　我被风声惊醒。当我看到我们遭到的不
幸时，恨不得跳进海里，让波浪把我埋葬。可是我平静下来，决定逆来顺受。肆
虐的大风又把我们送回埃洛斯的海岛。我让同伴们留在船上，只带了一个朋友和
一个使者去国王的宫殿。国王和妻子儿女们正在用午餐。他们看到我们又回来了，
感到很惊异。当他听说了我们转回来的原因时，管理风的埃洛斯生气地从椅子上
站起来，大声说：" 真是可恶的人，神}会惩罚你的！滚出去！" 他把我赶了出
去。

    我们悲伤地回到船上继续航行。我们在海上漂泊了七天，仍然没有看见陆地
的影子，都感到绝望了。　　最后，我们看到一处海岸，岸上有一座碉楼众多的
城堡。

    后来听说，它叫忒勒菲罗斯城，是莱斯特律戈涅斯人居住的地方。我们当时
还不知道，而且也看不清城里有什么古怪之处。我们驶进山岩包围的港口。港内
海水平静如镜。船停泊后，我登上山岩，放眼四望，看不到一块耕地，也看不到
牛羊。

    我只看见城头青烟升上天空。我派出两个朋友和一名使者前去侦察。他们沿
着一条林间小道向冒烟的地方走去，来到城墙附近，遇到一位年轻的妇女。她是
莱斯特律戈涅斯国王安提法忒斯的女儿，正要到阿尔塔奇亚的泉水那儿去汲水。
姑娘高大得使他们吃惊。她友好地给他们指点去父亲宫殿的路，并满足了他们的
愿望，介绍了关于城市和居民的情况。他们真的进了城，并走进宫殿，看见莱斯
特律戈涅斯人的王后，高大得如同一座山峰站在他们面前时，都惊得目瞪口呆。
看来莱斯特律戈涅斯人也是吃人的巨人。王后急忙叫出丈夫，他立即抓起使者，
国王下令将他洗净，烹煮，当作他的晚餐。其余两人吓得拼命逃跑。国王下令追
击。一千多全副武装的莱斯特律戈涅斯巨人追了上来，用巨石朝我们的船砸来，
四周响起船板破碎和垂死者的呻吟声。我早已把自己的船停在一块岩石的后面，
可怕的巨石砸不到这儿。其它的船都被砸沉了。后来我带着幸存下来的少数伙伴，
驾船逃离了港口。海面上漂浮着死尸，惨不忍睹。　　我们挤在一只船上，继续
航行。

    过了几天，来到埃埃厄海岛。这里住着美丽的女仙喀耳刻。她是太阳神和海
神女儿珀耳塞所生的孩子，是国王埃厄忒斯的妹妹。喀耳刻在岛上有一座漂亮的
宫殿。

    当我们驶进港湾时，还不知道谁住在这儿。我们停泊后，因过分疲劳和悲哀，
就躺在岸边的草地上睡着了，一直睡了两天两夜。第三天清晨，我佩着剑，执着
长矛，出发去探询情况。不久，我发现了一楼青烟从宫中升起，不禁想起不久前
发生的可怕的事情，因此决定还是回到朋友们的身边。当时我们快要断粮了，一
定是神}可怜我们，在我回来的途中突然发现一头高大的雄鹿。我用长矛掷去，
击中它的背部，枪尖从肚子上透出来。雄鹿尖叫一声倒在地上死了，我拔出长矛，
用柳条编成绳索，捆住鹿脚，然后将它背在背上，朝船走来。　　同伴们看到我
肩上扛回了一头漂亮的猎物非常高兴。我们将鹿肉烤得喷香，又找出剩下的一点
点面包和酒，坐下来大吃。我给他们讲起宫中冒出青烟的事，可是他们都没有勇
气去侦察，因为他们还记得库克普罗斯人的山洞和莱斯特律戈涅斯国王的海港。

    只有我一个人还没有丧失勇气。于是我把同伴们分为两队。我率领一队，欧
律罗科斯率领另一队。然后我们在战盔里抽签，结果欧律罗科斯中签，于是他带
着二十二名伙伴出发。他们心惊胆战地朝着我所看见有烟冒出的地方走去。　　
不久，他们到了一座华丽的宫殿，这宫殿坐落在绿荫遮蔽的山谷里，四周绕着漂
亮的围墙。这儿就是女仙喀耳刻居住的地方。他们走近宫门，突然看见宫院里有
许多野狼和猛狮在奔跑。野狼露出尖尖的牙齿，狮子抖动着蓬乱的鬣毛，他们怕
得正想逃跑时，那群野兽已将他们团团围住。奇怪的是那些野兽很温和，只是慢
慢地走过来，像向主人摇尾乞怜的狗一样。我们后来才知道，它们原来都是人，
是被喀耳刻用魔法变成了野兽。　　因为这些野兽没有伤害他们，所以他们又鼓
起勇气，走近宫殿的大门。他们听到宫殿里传来喀耳刻美妙的歌声，她一边唱歌，
一边赶织一件神奇而漂亮的衣裳。只有仙女才有这种本领。我的一个最要好的朋
友波吕忒斯最先看到她，感到很高兴。在他的建议下，我的朋友们一齐唤她出来。
喀耳刻走到门外，友好地请他们进去。除了欧律罗科斯外，大家都跟她进去了。
欧律罗科斯是一个很谨慎的人，他吸取了以往的教训，怀疑其中有诈。　　喀耳
刻把其余的人领进宫殿，请他们坐在华丽的椅子上。她端来了乳酪、面粉、蜂蜜
和醇厚的美酒，把它们掺和在一起，调制成可口的糕点。乘他们不注意时在里面
搀进了一些魔药。吃了这种糕点的人，就会神志迷乱，忘记他们的故乡，并变成
动物。

    我的同伴们刚咬了一口，就变成了全身长毛的公猪，并发出了猪叫声。这时
喀耳刻把他们赶进了猪圈，扔给他们一些僵硬的橡实和野果。　　欧律罗科斯从
远处把这一切都看在眼里。他连忙转身向船上奔来，想向我报告朋友们的悲惨遭
遇。

    他跑得气喘吁吁，到了船上，吓得一时说不出话来，只是流泪。在我们一再
催逼下，他才说出了这件恐怖的事。我一听，连忙佩上宝剑，拿起弓箭，要他带
我去宫殿。可是，他用双臂抱住我的双膝，恳求我留在这里，不要自投罗网。"
请相信我，" 他呜咽着说，" 你不但救不了朋友们，连自己也不能回来。还是让
我们赶快离开这个该死的海岛吧！" 我让他留下来了，独自去救我的朋友们。在
路上，我遇到一个年轻人，他向我举起金杖，因此，我很快认出他是神}的使者
赫耳墨斯，他友好地抓住我的手说：" 可怜的人哪，你在这里干什么？你的朋友
们全被迷人的喀耳刻变成了公猪，关在猪圈里。你想救出他们吗？弄不好你会像
他们一样。我在这里送你一样防身的东西。你只要带上这种药草，……" 他说着
从地上拔起一株开着白花的黑根草，告诉我这草是魔草。" 你只要带上这种草，
她就不能伤害你。他会给你调制一种甜蜜的酒，并乘机加进魔药。但这种草却可
以保护你，使她不能将你变成一头猪。如果他用长长的魔棒来触你，你就抽出宝
剑朝她奔过去，装出刺杀她的样子。这时，她就会求饶，你要迫使她发誓，保证
不伤害你。以后，你就可以放心地和她住在一起。等你和她熟悉后，她就不会拒
绝你的要求，相反会答应把你的朋友恢复成人！" 　　赫耳墨斯说完后，就离开
了，消失得无影无踪。于是，我朝喀耳刻的宫殿走去。到了宫门口，我大声呼唤
她。她走出来，友好地招呼我进去，请我坐在华丽的椅子上，并在我的脚下放了
一张搁脚凳，然后在一只金碗内调酒。还没等我把酒喝完，她就迫不及待地用魔
杖触我，并且毫不怀疑她的魔力。她说：" 到猪圈里去找你的朋友吧！" 我抽出
宝剑，朝她奔去。她惊叫一声，倒在地上，伸出双手抱住我的双膝，向我哀求：
" 可怜可怜我吧！伟大的人，你是谁？我的魔药对你也失效了，从来没有人能抵
抗我的魔力。莫非你就是奥德修斯？许多年前，赫耳墨斯向我预言，说你从特洛
伊回国时必经此地。如果真是这样，就请你收起宝剑，让我们成为朋友吧！" 可
是我并没有放下宝剑，回答她说：" 喀耳刻，你把我的随从骗进宫殿，用魔法将
他们变成猪，你怎能要求我做你的朋友呢？我不可能做你的朋友，除非你在这里
发誓，保证不伤害我。" 她像我要求的那样发了誓。现在我才放了心，安安稳稳
地睡了一夜。　　第二天清晨，她的四个侍女忙着整理屋子。她们都是美丽而高
雅的仙女。

    第一个仙女在椅子上铺上紫色的华丽的坐毯。第二个仙女搬来了银桌，摆上
了金篮。第三个仙女在银碗里调酒，然后倒在金杯里。第四个仙女汲来了清澈的
泉水，倒入火上的三足鼎里。等水烧热后，我就沐浴，抹香膏，穿上华丽的衣服，
然后和喀耳刻共进早餐。桌子上摆满了美味佳肴，然而我并未进食，只是默默地
坐在漂亮的女主人的对面，满面愁容。她禁不住问我，为什么如此忧郁。我对她
说：" 一个人在自己的朋友遭了难时，他哪有心绪高兴地饮宴呢？如果你要我高
高兴兴地和你用餐，就请你把我的朋友恢复人形！" 　　喀耳刻立即拿起魔杖，
离开了屋子，把我的朋友们从猪圈里赶了出来。他们都围着我，看上去都像九年
的老猪一样。喀耳刻用另一种魔药一个个地涂抹他们，突然猪毛脱落，他们又变
成了人，而且比以前更年轻，更英俊。这时女神殷勤地对我说：" 我满足了你的
愿望，请你也满足我的一个愿望吧。把你的船拉上岸，将船上的货物都运到岸边
的山洞里，你和你的朋友们都留在我这里愉快地生活吧！" 　　喀耳刻殷勤的话
赢得了我的心。我很快回到海上去见留守的朋友。他们以为我早就死了，现在看
到我，都欢呼着奔了过来。我建议他们把船拉上岸，然后都到喀耳刻那里住一段
时间。

    除了欧律罗科斯，大家都同意了。欧律罗科斯说：" 你们真的愿意和女巫住
在一起？你们也想变成狮子、野狼和猪仔，为她看守她的宫殿。你们怎么会有这
么大的兴趣，心甘情愿地走向毁灭？你们忘了奥德修斯头脑发热时让我们落到库
克罗普斯人的手里，我们所遇到的危险吗？" 当我听他讲这话时，我恨不得拔剑
朝他砍去，尽管他是我的亲戚。朋友们看到我手按宝剑，连忙冲过来抓住我的手，
使我又变得理智了。　　我们收拾停当，便出发了。欧律罗科斯也被我的举动唬
住了，不得不跟大家一起走。这时，喀耳刻已为宫中我的朋友们备好热水。他们
洗过澡抹上香膏，穿上华丽的衣服。当我们到了宫殿时，他们正高高兴兴地用早
餐。

    朋友们别后重聚，互相拥抱，高兴得流泪。女仙请我们放心，并热情地招待
我们。

    所以我们的心情一天比一天快乐，在她那里整整住了一年。朋友们劝我动身
回国。

    我也产生了思乡之情。当天晚上，我抱住喀耳刻的双膝，恳求她履行诺言，
放我回去。喀耳刻回答说：" 你说得对，奥德修斯。我不能强迫你留在这儿。可
是在你回家前，你必须先到地狱去，到哈得斯和珀耳塞福涅的阴间王国去，向底
比斯的预言家提瑞西阿斯的幽灵询问未来的事。老人虽然死了，但珀耳塞福涅仍
然让他保留了预言未来的本领。" 　　我听到她的话，不禁毛骨悚然，并哭了起
来。

    我害怕去见死去的人。于是，我问她，谁当我的向导，因为还没有一个活人
游历过地府。" 别担心，" 喀耳刻回答说，" 你只要竖起桅杆，张起船帆，一阵
风将会把你吹到那里。当你渡过包围地球的海洋，到达俄刻阿诺斯海滩时，你就
在长着一排排白杨树和柳树的地方登陆。这就是珀耳塞福涅的圣林，在这里你将
找到地府的入口处。这里是两条黑河，即菲律弗勒格通河和库奇托斯河流入阿赫
隆河的地方，两条黑河其实是冥河的支流。在山谷的一块岩石边，你会发现一个
裂口。

    你必须在那里挖一个小洞，供上蜂蜜、牛奶、水和面粉，给亡灵献祭，并且
许愿回到伊塔刻后再给他们献祭。当然，你应该给提瑞西阿斯献祭一头黑山羊。
你还应该献祭一公一母两头黑羊，在你的同伴们献祭牲口焚烧祭品，并向神}祈
祷时，你就从岩石缝里望着里面的溪水。这时你会看见死者的幽灵，这些幽灵会
争相涌来，想尝尝祭品的鲜血。你必须用剑把它们挡住，在向提瑞西阿斯打听前
程前别让它们靠近。他很快就会出现，并给你指点回家的路程。" 　　她的话使
我稍感安慰。第二天早晨，我把朋友们召集在一起，准备动身。可是他们中有个
最年轻的人埃尔朋诺尔，既无勇，又无谋，昨晚他多喝了喀耳刻的美酒，离开了
大家，外出呼吸新鲜空气，独自一人躺在宫殿的屋顶上。他在那儿睡着了，过了
整整一夜。当朋友们忙着动身的喧哗声把他惊醒时。他跳起来，却不知自己在何
处。他没有朝楼梯走去，反而朝屋檐走去，结果从屋顶上栽下来，摔断了脖子，
下了地府。我把同伴们召到我的周围，对他们说：" 你们一定以为，尊贵的朋友
们，我们现在动身直接回家了。可是情况却不是这样。因为喀耳刻建议我们走另
外一条路。我们必须往下走，到哈得斯的地府里去，到那里向底比斯预言家提瑞
西阿斯的幽灵询问我们的归程！" 同伴们听到这话，心都要碎了。他们纷纷抱怨，
扯着自己的头发。但这些抱怨都无济于事。我命令他们立即跟我一起到海船上去。
喀耳刻已在我们前面，把献祭的羊送上了船，还为我们准备了充足的蜂蜜、美酒
和面粉。我们到海边时，她就悄悄地走了。我们把船推到海里，竖桅张帆，然后
心情沉重地坐下来摇桨。喀耳刻给我们送来一阵顺风，鼓起船帆。不一会，我们
又在大海上航行了。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事9 ：喀孔涅斯人，食忘忧果的民族，库克罗普斯
人，波吕斐摩斯

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    我们的船被一阵大风从伊利翁一直吹到伊斯玛洛斯，那是喀孔涅斯人的都城。

    我们杀死守城的男人，瓜分了妇女和其他的财物。我建议我的朋友们赶快离
开那里。可是我的同伴们听不进我的话。他们贪图战利品，并留下来饮酒作乐。
那些逃走了的喀孔涅斯人从内地搬来了救兵，乘我们欢宴时突然向我们发起攻击。
我们寡不敌众，可怜我的六个同伴还没有站起身就被杀死在餐桌上，其余的人幸
好逃得快，才幸免于难。　　我们向西航行，庆幸逃脱了死神的威胁，可是心里
却为死去的同伴感到悲哀。后来，宙斯从北方吹来一阵飓风。海上顿时波涛汹涌，
战船陷于一片黑暗中。我们忙着放下船桅，可是还没有等船桅放下，两根桅杆已
经折断，船帆被撕成碎片。我们好容易才驶到岸边，在这里停泊了两天两夜，才
把桅杆修好，配制了新的船帆。然后，我们又启航了，满怀着回乡的热切希望。

    然而，我们刚到伯罗奔尼撒南端的玛勒亚时，北方吹来的一阵巨风，又把我
们送回了浩翰的大海。我们在风浪中颠簸了九天九夜。到了第十天，我们来到洛
托法根人的海岸。这是一个食忘忧果的民族。我们上岸汲足了淡水，并派两个同
伴在一个使者的陪同下去打探情况。他们发现食忘忧果的人正在召开国民大会。
他们受到隆重而热情的接待。主人捧出忘忧果，请他们品尝。这种忘忧果具有奇
特的作用，比蜂蜜还甜，吃过的人就会忘记忧愁，乐而忘返，希望永远留在那里。
我们派出去的人都不愿回船了，我们只得强行把他们拖上了船。　　我们又继续
航行，来到野蛮的库克罗普斯人居住的地方。他们不耕不织，一切听从神}的安
排。

    这里的土地肥沃，不用耕种就能五谷丰收，葡萄藤上结满累累的葡萄。宙斯
使这儿每年风调雨顺，并普降甘霖，使土地肥沃。他们没有法律，也不召开国民
大会。

    他们都住在山上的岩洞里，和自己的妻儿生活，从不与邻人往来。在邻近库
克罗普斯的海湾外，有一座森林茂密的小岛。岛上野羊成群，自由自在，从来没
有猎人去捕杀。岛上无人居住，因为库克罗普斯人不会造船，没有人能够渡海到
岛上去。岛上土地肥沃，只要有人耕种，很容易获得丰收。这里的滩涂绿草丛生，
土质松软，那些小山坡是种植葡萄的好地方。这里有天然的避风港，船只进了海
湾不用下锚系缆，也很安稳。在黑夜里，神}引导我们来到这座美丽的小岛。天
亮时，我们上岛围猎，打到许多山羊。我们共有十二只船，每只船上分到九只山
羊，我自己留下十只。一整天，我们高高兴兴地坐在海岸上吃羊肉，喝着从喀孔
涅斯人那儿抢来的葡萄酒。　　第二天清晨，我突发奇想，希望上对岸去看看那
里的风土人情。那时我对那里的居民还一无所知。我们摇船过去，上了岸，看到
高耸的山洞，周围长满桂树，树下是成群的绵羊和山羊，巨大的石块砌成围墙，
墙外是松树和栎树构成的高大的围篱。这儿住着一个身材高大的巨人，他在远处
的牧场上放牧，孤独一人，跟邻人毫无往来。他是一个库克罗普斯人。　　我挑
选了十二名最勇敢的朋友和我同行，并吩咐其余的人都留在船上。我带上一皮袋
美酒，这是在伊斯玛洛斯时一个阿波罗神庙的祭司送给我的礼物，因为我曾经饶
了他的性命。此外，我还挑了一些精美的食物，把酒和食物都放在篮子里，我想
这些东西一定能够赢得巨人的欢心。　　当我们来到山洞时，巨人还没有回家，
他仍然在牧场上放牧。我们走进山洞。看到里面的陈设非常惊讶。大块的乳酪饼
装了一篮又一篮，羊圈里挤满了绵羊和山羊，地上到处是篮子、挤奶桶和水罐。
我的同伴劝我马上把乳酪拿走，把绵羊和山羊赶上船，然后回到岛上的朋友那里
去。唉，我要是听从他们的劝告该多好啊！可是我抑制不住自己的好奇心，一心
想看看山洞里住的是什么人。我宁愿得到他的一份礼物，也不愿将他的东西偷走，
不光彩地离开这里。于是，我们点起一堆火，向神}祭献供品。然后我们也吃了
一点乳酪，等待主人回来。　　他终于回来了，宽阔的肩膀上扛了一捆巨大的干
木柴。

    他把木柴扔在地上，发出一阵可怕的轰然声。我们吓得跳起来，躲在洞中的
角落里，看着他把母羊群赶进山洞，公绵羊和山羊仍留在外面的围栏里。然后，
他搬来一块巨石封住了洞口。这块巨石连二十二匹马也不能拖动！巨人重重地坐
在地上，一面挤绵羊和山羊的奶，一面让羔羊吸母羊的奶。他把一半的羊奶倒入
无花果汁中拌和，使之成为凝乳，并装在篮子里，让它干燥。他又把另一半羊奶
盛在大盆里，这是他一天的饮料。巨人做完这一切，才开始点火，这时他猛然发
现我们挤在山洞的角落里。我们也第一次清楚地看到这个高大的巨人。他像所有
的库克罗普斯人一样，只有一只闪闪发光的眼睛，长在额间。他的两条大腿犹如
千年橡树，双臂和双手粗壮又有力，可以把岩石当作皮球玩。　　" 外乡人，你
们是谁呀？" 巨人粗暴地问道，声音如响雷。" 你们从哪里来？你们是强盗吗？
或者你们是做买卖的？" 我们被问得心惊胆颤，最后，我壮起胆子，回答说："
我们是希腊人，刚从特洛伊战场上回来。我们在海上迷了路，到这里来请求你的
帮助和保护。请敬畏神}，倾听我们的请求吧。因为宙斯保护寻求保护的人，他
将严厉地惩罚那些危害哀求者的人！" 　　那个库克罗普斯人发出一阵可怕的笑
声，并且说：" 外乡人，你是一个傻瓜，还根本不知道跟谁在讲话！你以为我们
敬畏神}，并怕他们报复吗？即使雷神宙斯和其他的神}加在一起，我们库克罗
普斯人难道会害怕吗？我们比他们强大十倍！除非我愿意，否则不会放过你和你
的朋友们！现在告诉我，你们的船在哪里？你们把它藏在什么地方？" 　　库克
罗普斯人问得很狡猾，可是我已有提防，因此回答得更狡猾。" 好朋友，我的船
嘛，" 我说，" 已经被大地的震撼者波塞冬在山岩上摔得粉碎。我和这十二个人
死里逃生！" 巨人听了以后一声不响，他伸出大手，抓起我的两个同伴，像扔两
只小狗似地把他们摔在地上。两人顿时脑浆迸裂，血肉模糊地躺在地上。巨人将
他们撕开，如同山中的饿狮一样吞食它的猎物。他不仅食他们的肉，而且把内脏、
骨髓，连同骨头都吃光了。我们悲痛难忍，高举双手向宙斯祈祷，控诉巨人的罪
恶。

    巨人吃饱了，又喝了羊奶解渴，然后躺在山洞的地上睡了。我想朝他走过去，
用利剑刺入他的胁部，结果他的生命。但我很快放弃了这个念头，因为这样做对
我们并没有好处。谁能把巨大的石块从洞里搬开呢？我们仍会封在洞里活活地饿
死。因此，我们只能听凭他酣睡，在恐惧中坐待天明。第二天早晨，库克罗普斯
人起身了，他点上火，开始挤奶了。等到把这些事做完后，他又抓起我的两个同
伴作为他的早餐。我们恐怖地看着他。他吃完后，搬开洞口的巨石，把羊群赶出
山洞，自己也走出去，然后，又把石头塞住洞口。我们听到他挥着响鞭，吆喝着
牧群走开了。我们每个人都惶恐地留在山洞里，默默地等待着下一次轮到自己被
吃掉。　　我寻思着逃生的办法，终于我想出了一个好办法，并觉得这是切实可
行的。在羊圈里有一根库克罗普斯人使用的巨大的木棒，这是新砍下的橄榄木，
像大船上的桅杆一样。我用它削了一根六尺长的杆子。我请朋友们将它磨滑，然
后将杆子的一端削尖，放在火上烤干，使它变得十分坚硬。我小心地把它藏在山
洞一边的粪堆里。这时我们抽签决定在巨人睡着时由谁帮我把尖木杆戳进他的独
眼中去，抽签选出了四个最勇敢的人，他们正是我所要挑选的人。　　晚上，可
怕的巨人又赶着牧群回来了。这一次他没有让一部分羊留在外面的院子里，而是
全部赶到洞里。也许他有点怀疑了，也许是神}决定帮助我们。故事的结局你们
马上就会听到。　　像昨晚一样，巨人又把石头堵住洞口，并抓去我的两个同伴。

    他正在吞食时，我解开盛酒的皮袋，把浓浓的美酒倒进木桶，将它送到巨人
面前，说：" 收下吧，库克罗普斯人，请喝吧！吃人肉喝这样的酒真是再好不过
了。你应该尝尝，我要你知道我们在船上带了一种多醇的美酒。我特意把它送给
你，希望你可怜我们，放我们回去。但你待我们却这样凶狠，但愿以后没有人再
来找你。

    " 　　库克罗普斯人接过木桶，一句话也不说便将桶里的酒一饮而尽。可以
看得出酒的芬芳和强烈使他感到心满意足。他第一次用友好的口气说道：" 外乡
人，再给我喝一桶，将你的名字告诉我，让我以后也送你一件满意的礼物。我们，
我们库克罗普斯人也有美酒。为了让你知道在你面前的人是谁，那么我告诉你吧
：我叫波吕斐摩斯。" 　　他这么要求，我当然乐意再给他喝更多的酒。于是我
接连给他倒了三桶，他也连续喝了三桶，乘他酒兴发作，神志迷糊时，我灵机一
动，对他说：" 库克罗普斯人，你想知道我的名字吗？我的名字很奇特。我叫'
无人' ，大家都叫我' 无人'." 库克罗普斯人说：" 好的，你应该得到回报！无
人，我将在最后一个吃你。无人，你对这份赠礼感到满意吗？" 　　他讲最后这
句话时舌头已经僵硬，说不清楚了。他身子向后仰去，随即倒在地上，粗壮的脖
子歪在一边，酒糊糊地打起鼾来。我飞快把尖杆放进火堆里。当它点着时，我迅
速把它抽出来，由四个朋友帮助我，抓住木杆，狠命戳进巨人的眼睛里。我转动
着木杆，就像木匠在木头上钻孔一样。巨人的睫毛和眉毛都已烧焦，发出吱吱的
声音。

    他的那只被烫伤戳瞎的眼睛也吱吱作响，如同灼热的铁块浸入冷水一般。巨
人痛得大声吼叫，声音响彻山洞，格外恐怖。我们吓得蜷缩在山洞的角落里。　
　波吕斐摩斯将木杆从眼睛里拔出来，把它丢得远远的，眼里鲜血直流。他狂怒
得像发了疯似的，尖声叫喊起来，呼唤其他的库克罗普斯人。他的住在山上的本
族兄弟急忙跑来，围着山洞，询问他发生了什么事。巨人在山洞里大声说；" 兄
弟们，无人刺杀我！无人骗了我！" 外面的库克罗普斯人听到他的回答，便说：
" 既然无人伤害你，你在这里叫什么？你莫非发了疯吗？这种病我们库克罗普斯
人是不会医治的。" 说完，他们一哄而散。我却高兴极了，连心儿也在胸膛里发
出了呵呵的笑声。　　这个瞎了眼的库克罗普斯人痛苦地呻吟着，摸索着来到洞
口，掀开门口的巨石，自己坐在洞里，伸出一只手，不断地摸索着，想抓住趁机
和羊群一直逃出去的人。我左思右想，终于想出一个办法。我看到周围都是毛皮
特别厚实的肥羊。我悄悄地用柳条将它们每三只捆在一起。在中间一只公羊的肚
子下带我们的一个人，旁边的两只正好掩护他。我自己选了那只最大的头羊，抓
住羊背，骑上去，然后慢慢地转到它的肚子下，紧紧贴住。我们就这样贴在羊身
下，等着天亮。　　天终于亮了，公羊先跑出洞外到牧场吃草。母羊乳房鼓鼓的，
咩咩地叫着，等着挤奶。它们的倒霉的主人在每一头往外窜的公羊的背上仔细地
摸着，知道上面没有人。愚蠢的巨人绝没有想到羊肚下藏着人。载我的那只羊走
得慢，最后才到门口。波吕斐摩斯摸着它说：" 我的好羊，你今天怎么落在最后
了？你平时总是走在羊群的最前面。你总是第一个走到草地，第一个走到溪水边，
晚上，你也总是第一个回到羊圈。你难道在为主人悲哀吗？是啊，如果你跟我一
样，也能说话，那么你一定会告诉我，那个可恶的人和他的同伴藏在哪里。我要
把他的脑袋在山洞的墙上撞碎，我才会解恨。" 　　巨人说着也让这头羊走出洞
口。现在我们都到了洞外。我第一个从羊肚下面钻出来，然后将我的同伴一个个
地从羊肚下面解下来。可惜我们只剩下七个人了。我们拥抱在一起，并为死去的
同伴感到悲哀。我劝他们不要难过，快把羊群赶到船上去。等我们都上了船，在
海上航行了一段距离，我才朝赶着羊群，爬上山坡的库克罗普斯巨人嘲弄般地呼
喊：" 喂，波吕斐摩斯，你的对手并非等闲之辈，你的恶行得到了报应，你已经
尝到神}的惩罚！" 　　波吕斐摩斯听到了这话，怒不可遏。他从山上抓起一块
石头，顺着喊声朝我们的船掷来。他掷得很准，差点砸中船舵。巨石激起的波浪
和水花把我们的船又冲回岸边。我们奋力划动，才使船离开了巨人。我又一次大
声呼喊起来，虽然我的朋友们担心他用石头砸来，竭力劝阻我。" 听着，库克罗
普斯人！

    " 我大声叫着，" 如果有人问你，是谁戳瞎了你的眼睛，你最好能给他们一
个正确的回答，不要像上次那样回答！告诉他们：你的眼睛是征服特洛伊城的英
雄，拉厄耳忒斯的儿子，伊塔刻的奥德修斯戳瞎的！" 　　库克罗普斯人听到这
话，愤怒地吼道：" 古老的预言现在应验了！多年前欧律摩斯的儿子，预言家忒
勒摩斯说，我的眼睛将会被奥德修斯戳瞎。我一直以为他是一个高大的家伙，跟
我一样是巨人，而且力大无穷，敢于跟我单独决斗。想不到他竟是这么一个弱小
的人，他用酒把我灌醉，乘我熟睡时，把我的眼睛戳瞎！可是，奥德修斯，我请
求你回来，这次我会待你像宾客一样，并请海神保佑你一路平安。你要知道，我
就是波塞冬的儿子。" 说着，他就祈求父亲波塞冬在我的归途上制造灾难，最后
还说：" 即使他能回到故乡，也要尽量拖延很久，让他受尽漂流之苦，让他在船
上忍受孤独的折磨，让他回家后也遭到不幸！" 　　我相信，海神一定答应了儿
子的请求。不久，我们回到了那个小岛，其余的船只还停留在这里。朋友们见我
们久久没有回来，正在焦急。看到我们回来了，他们都大声欢呼。我们上岸后，
立即分配从库克罗普斯人那里带回的羊。朋友们都同意把载我逃生的那只羊分给
我，我把它献祭给宙斯，并焚烧羊腿献给他。可是神}不接收这个祭品，不愿跟
我们和解。神}已经决定毁灭我的同伴和所有的船只。　　当然，神}的这个决
定，我们并不知道。我们高兴地坐在一起，饮酒食肉，直到太阳落进大海，我们
好像全成了无忧无虑的人。后来我们躺在海岸上沉沉睡去。第二天，太阳升起在
海上时，我们又上了船，向故乡航行。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事8 ：奥德修斯叙述他的漂流故事

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    我是拉厄耳忒斯的儿子奥德修斯。我的故乡在阳光灿烂的伊塔刻岛。在特洛
伊战争结束后，我返回家乡。现在请你们听我讲讲归途中的漂流故事吧。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事7 ：奥德修斯和淮阿喀亚人

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    瑙西卡回到父亲的宫殿时，奥德修斯离开了圣林，雅典娜一路上帮助他。为
了防止自负的淮阿喀亚人伤害他，她用浓雾罩住他，而他自己却毫无察觉。当临
近城门的时候，她不得不变形为一个淮阿喀亚姑娘，手里提着一只水罐，走到奥
德修斯面前。" 小姑娘，" 大英雄招呼她说，" 你愿意给我指点去国王阿尔喀诺
俄斯的宫殿的路吗？我是外乡人，在这里不认识一个人！" 　　" 我很愿意为你
指路，因为你是一个好人，" 女神回答说。" 我的父亲就住在附近，你可以放心
地跟着我走。这里的人不太喜欢外乡人。艰难的海洋生活使他们的心肠也变硬了！

    " 说着，雅典娜就在前面引路，奥德修斯跟在她后面，淮阿喀亚人却看不见
他的身影。一路上，他高兴地欣赏着码头、船只、高大的城墙。最后，他们到了
一个地方，雅典娜说：" 这里就是阿尔喀诺俄斯的宫殿，你放心地进去吧。有一
件事我要提醒你，你必须先找王后！她的名字叫阿瑞忒，她是她丈夫的侄女。阿
尔喀诺俄斯非常敬重她，淮阿喀亚人也非常尊敬她。她聪明，贤淑，善于用智慧
调解人民的争端。你要是能得到她的同情，就用不着担心了。" 　　女神说完就
匆匆离开了。奥德修斯沉思地站在门前，注视着这座华丽的宫殿。高大的殿堂金
光灿烂，如同太阳放射着光芒。宫门两边是镶铜的宫墙。内廷有黄金大门，银制
的门柱，门楣也是银铸的，底座则是黄铜的，门扣是金的。门的两旁立着由赫淮
斯托斯铸造的金狗银狗，好像守卫王宫的武士一样。奥德修斯走入大厅，他看到
一排软椅，椅上铺着富丽而精致的坐垫。王侯和贵族坐在这里饮宴。在高高的托
架上立着金童像，他们手中举着火把，饮宴时照得如同白昼。宫中有五十个女仆，
有的磨面，有的织布，有的纺线。这里的妇女善于纺织，就像淮阿喀亚男人长于
航海一样。宫廷外是一个果园，砌有围墙，园内种着梨树、无花果、石榴、橄榄
和苹果树。淮阿喀亚国一年四季吹着温暖的西风，不管冬天还是夏天都有水果。
在同一季节，有些树木在开花，而有些树木则已结果。果园旁边是葡萄园。在阳
光下，晶莹的葡萄闪闪发光。有的葡萄已经采摘了，有的则刚刚绽出花蕾。花园
的另一边花团锦簇，芳香沁人心脾。一道泉水蜿蜒流经花园，另一道泉水则从宫
门旁流过。　　居民们都在这里汲水。　　奥德修斯尽情观赏了好一会，就径直
走进国王的大厅。淮阿喀亚的显贵正在欢宴。因为天色已晚，大家都准备结束宴
会，并向神}赫耳墨斯举行祭礼。奥德修斯在浓雾的包围中穿过人群，来到国王
和王后面前。雅典娜一举手，在他周围的浓雾顿时消失，他上前跪在王后阿瑞忒
的脚下，抱住她的双膝，哀怜地恳求说：" 啊，克塞诺耳的女儿阿瑞忒哟，我作
为一个哀求者，匍伏在你和你的丈夫面前，愿神}赐予你们幸福和欢乐，请你们
帮助我，这个流亡在外的可怜人重返家乡！我已经在外流浪很久了。" 　　淮阿
喀亚人看到他都惊住了。最后，宾客中阅历丰富的长老厄刻纳俄斯打破了沉默，
对国王说；" 天哪，阿尔喀诺俄斯，让这位外乡人伏在地上是不礼貌的，应请他
就坐，并命传令官调制美酒，让我们给保护神宙斯举行浇祭礼。同时，女仆要给
新来的客人端上酒食！" 　　国王听到这话很满意，他扶起奥德修斯，让他坐在
自己身边的椅子上。这里原来坐着国王的爱子拉俄达马斯，他给客人让出了位置。
在向宙斯举行了祭礼后，宴会散了。国王邀请宾客第二天再来饮宴。他没有问外
乡人是谁，从哪儿来，就允许他住在宫中，并保证让他平安地返回自己的家乡。
说完，他又仔细地端量这位外乡人。雅典娜使他更具神}般的仪态和光彩。国王
不禁对他说：" 如果你是一位不朽的神}，变形为凡人来参加饮宴，那么你就用
不着我们的帮助。相反，我们应该请求你的保护！" 　　" 啊，国王哟，请别这
样想！

    " 奥德修斯连忙起身回答说，" 我跟你们一样，是一个凡人！而且，是人间
饱受苦难的最不幸的人。" 　　当客人们都离去，只剩下国王、王后和外乡人时，
阿瑞忒望着他身上漂亮的衣服，突然认出了这是她织造的。她非常奇怪，问道：
" 外乡人，我想问你一个问题。请告诉我，你从哪儿来，是谁送给你这件漂亮的
衣服的？" 奥德修斯如实叙述了他被仙女卡吕普索留在俄奇吉亚岛，后来，在海
上遭到风浪，漂到这儿，遇上了瑙西卡。　　" 我的女儿应该这样做。" 国王阿
尔喀诺俄斯微笑着说，" 但她却没有完全尽到义务。她应该马上把你带来见我！
""国王哟，请别责怪她，" 奥德修斯说，" 她本来准备这样做的，但我拒绝了。
因为我怕引起你的怀疑！" 　　" 我绝不会多疑的，" 国王说，" 但做一切事有
个规矩总是好事。现在，如果神意要求像你这样的人娶我的女儿为妻，我是多么
愿意啊！我愿意给你宫殿和财产！但我不会强迫你留在这里。明天，我将给你海
船和水手，使你可以回到家乡去。我尽力帮助你。" 　　奥德修斯非常感谢他的
盛情。他告辞出来，睡在一张柔软的床上，消除了疲劳和困乏。　　第二天清晨，
国王召集人民在市场上举行会议。他把客人也带到会上。大家都惊奇地打量着拉
厄耳忒斯的儿子，雅典娜已给予他非凡的品貌和威严。国王郑重地把外乡人介绍
给他的人民。他要求市民们准备一艘大海船和五十二名淮阿喀亚年轻的水手。同
时，他还邀请在场的贵族共赴招待外乡人的宴会，并命令阿罗波曾赋予音乐天才
的歌手特摩多科斯在席间献艺。　　集会结束后，年轻的水手们准备了一艘坚固
的大船。他们竖上桅杆，挂上船帆，用皮带缚紧船桨。一切准备停当后，他们来
到国王的宫殿。宫殿的大厅和庭院里挤满了应邀的贵宾。仆人们杀了十二只羊，
八只猪和两头公牛。宴会结束后，盲歌手以嘹亮的歌喉歌唱扬名四海的特洛伊英
雄。其中最著名的两位英雄是人所皆知的阿喀琉斯和奥德修斯。　　奥德修斯听
到他的名字在歌中被人赞颂时，不由得用披风遮住脸，以免别人看到他在流泪。

    坐在一旁的国王注意到了，便命歌手停止唱歌，同时宣布进行竞赛，以此向
外乡人致敬。" 我们的客人，" 国王说，" 回国以后你不要忘记告诉家乡人，我
们淮阿喀亚人善于拳击、角力、跳远和赛跑。" 随着国王一声令下，大家都涌到
市场上。许多贵族青年竞相参赛，其中有国王阿尔喀诺俄斯的三个儿子，即拉俄
达马斯，哈利俄斯和克吕托尼奥斯。他们以赛跑开场。克吕托尼奥斯一路领先，
第一个到达终点。接着进行角力竞赛，淮阿喀亚人阿姆菲亚洛斯获胜。厄拉特柔
斯取得掷铁饼的桂冠。国王的儿子拉俄达马斯在拳击比赛中获胜。　　现在，拉
俄达马斯站起来对比赛的年轻人说：" 朋友们，我们都希望看看外乡人有什么竞
赛技能！" 　　" 对，你说得对，" 欧律阿罗斯说，" 你应该亲自问问他，邀请
他比赛！" 拉俄达马斯有礼貌地走到外乡人面前，邀请他参赛。　　奥德修斯推
辞说：" 年轻人，你们该不是想看我的笑话吧？我很悲伤，根本没有兴趣参加比
赛。

    我饱受了折磨，现在只想早日回到我的祖国，我的故乡！" 　　欧律阿罗斯
不高兴地说：" 外乡人，你的讲话不像出于一个战士之口。你也许是一个优秀的
船长或者聪明的商人。你不是一位英雄。" 　　奥德修斯听到这话皱起了眉头，
对他说：" 我的朋友，这可不是一句好听的话。我并不是竞技场上的无能之辈。
在年轻时，我总是跟最强的对手较量。现在不同了，多年的战斗和海上的风浪已
使我疲惫不堪。但你既然向我挑战，我只好试试了！" 　　说着，奥德修斯从坐
位上站起来，连披风都没脱下，伸手抓起一只又大又厚的铁饼，用力将它掷了出
去。

    铁饼呼呼地响着在空中飞过。附近的人忙弯下腰，朝后退，铁饼远远地超过
了标志线。雅典娜变形为一个淮阿喀亚人，在铁饼落地的地方做了个标记，然后
大声说：" 连盲人也看得出，你比任何人都要掷得远。在这项比赛中，谁也不会
超过你！" 　　奥德修斯想到在淮阿喀亚人中能有这样一个好朋友非常高兴，他
愉快地对他说：" 行了，年轻人，你掷的话，也能掷这么远！而你，刚才讥讽我
的那位青年，请到这里来，你还想举行哪些比赛呢？我愿奉陪，决不退缩！不过，
我是不会跟拉俄达马斯比赛的。客人怎能和款待他的主人竞赛呢？" 　　年轻的
淮阿喀亚人听了都默默无言。这时国王说道：" 外乡人，你对我们显示了你的力
量。

    从现在起，没有人不佩服你。当你回到家里跟妻儿团聚时，请别忘了对他们
讲起我们的风范和道德。我们在拳击和角力方面也许并不出色，但在航海和奔跑
方面还是相当出色的。至于弹琴、跳舞，我们都有这方面的行家。我们有最美丽
的首饰，最舒适的浴池，最柔软的床榻，这些你都看到了。现在，唱歌、跳舞的
人走出来吧，给外乡人表演一下，献出你们的技艺！别忘了把特摩多科斯的竖琴
也带来。" 　　一个使者取来了竖琴。九个年轻人收拾好场地，准备表演舞蹈。
琴手走到中间。舞蹈表演开始了。奥德修斯惊叹不已，他还从来没有看过如此美
妙的舞蹈。接着，歌手唱起一首动人的歌，歌颂神}欢乐的生活。跳过轮舞后，
国王命令他的儿子拉俄达马斯和伶俐的哈利俄斯跳对舞。一个人手上捧了一只小
球，仰身把球往空中掷去，另一人跳起来在空中把球接住。他们敏捷地换着舞步，
轻快地跳跃。一旁观看的人有节奏地拍着手，为他们助兴。　　奥德修斯由衷地
钦佩，转身对国王说：" 国王阿尔喀诺俄斯哟，可以毫不夸张地说，你们拥有世
界上最优秀的舞蹈家！" 阿尔喀诺俄斯听了他的赞誉非常高兴。他对淮阿喀亚人
说：" 你们都听到了吗？你们听到这位外乡人对你们的赞美吗？他是一个有眼力
的人，值得我们送给他丰富的礼物。我们国内共有十二位王子，连我在一起共有
十三人，每人应带来一件披风，一件紧身衣和一泰伦特黄金。然后我们把这些礼
物全送给他，作为临别的赠品，他一定会感到高兴的。此外，欧律阿罗斯应该向
外乡人道歉，别让他对我们有丝毫的不满。" 淮阿喀亚人听到国王的讲话都齐声
欢呼。于是，一个使者站起来去收集礼物。欧律阿罗斯还把那柄象牙剑鞘和银柄
宝剑赠给外乡人。他说：" 如果我的话冒犯了你，那就让它随风飘散吧。愿神}
保佑你平安地回到家乡！淮阿喀亚人祝愿你幸福快乐！""但愿你不会懊悔送给我
贵重的礼物！" 奥德修斯一面说，一面将宝剑佩在身上。日落时，所有的礼物都
已收齐，放在王后的面前。国王阿尔喀诺俄斯向王后要了一只精致的箱子，把衣
服和黄金装在箱内，然后把箱子送到奥德修斯的住处。国王还送了他许多衣袍和
一只贵重的金杯。奥德修斯小心地关上箱盖，用绳结将箱子捆结实，最后又用温
水沐浴。然后，准备到大厅和宾客们欢饮。这时他突然看到瑙西卡在大厅的门口。

    奥德修斯进宫后还是第一次看到她。公主为人庄重，深居内廷，不参加男子
们的宴饮。现在，她想跟高贵的客人告别。公主赞叹地望着他的魁梧的身材和俊
美的面庞，温柔地说：" 高贵的客人，愿你健康幸福！希望你归国后也能时常想
起我！

    " 奥德修斯深受感动，回答说：" 尊敬的瑙西卡，如果神}给我赐福，让我
平安地回到故乡，我一定把你当作神}一样，向你祈祷，因为你是我的救命恩人。
" 说着，他进入大厅，在国王身边坐下。仆人们正忙着倒酒，分肉。盲人歌手特
摩多科斯被带进来，坐在中间。奥德修斯把使者唤来，将面前的烤猪肉亲自割下
最好的一块，放在盘内，对使者说：" 朋友，请把这块肉送给歌手，我应该向他
表示敬意。歌手应该处处受到尊重，因为他们是缪斯的学生。缪斯教给他们歌唱，
并到处照顾他们。" 盲人歌手十分感激地收下他赠送的食物。　　饮宴完毕，奥
德修斯又转身对特摩多科斯说：" 我在世人面前赞美你，亲爱的歌手。你美妙地
歌唱了希腊英雄的命运，好像你身临其境，亲眼看到，亲耳听见了这一切事情一
样。来吧，继续唱下去吧，唱一唱木马计的故事和奥德修斯的业绩吧！" 歌手愉
快地听从了他的吩咐，所有的人都静静地听他歌唱。当奥德修斯听到歌颂他的事
迹时，他又禁不住暗暗地流下泪来。国王阿尔喀诺俄斯注意到了，止住了歌手的
歌唱，并说：" 我们最好还是让竖琴休息吧。自从歌声响起时，我们的客人更加
忧伤，更加悲哀。我们无法使他欢乐。外乡人哟，请告诉我们，你的父母亲是谁，
你从什么地方来？我并非出于好奇而问你，我们必须先知道你的祖国，知道你的
家乡，我们淮阿喀亚水手才能把你送回去。除此以外，他们什么也不想知道。他
们不需要向导。他们只要知道地名，就能穿过浓雾或黑夜，驾船向目的地航行！
" 　　奥德修斯听到这友好的要求，回答说：" 尊敬的国王，你不要以为歌手并
没有给我带来欢乐！正好相反，听到美妙的歌喉，真是一件乐事。瞧，一个民族
英雄的事迹由歌手歌唱，客人们在美食面前，一边品尝，饮酒，一边倾听，世上
再也没有比这更快乐的事了。亲爱的主人，如果你真想知道我的身世，我也愿意
趁着酒兴说给朋友们听听，以此感谢朋友们对我深厚的情意！"

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事6 ：瑙西卡

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    奥德修斯躺在草地上熟睡，这时他的保护女神雅典娜正在着手为他安排。女
神赶到舍利亚岛，在岛上淮阿喀亚人建了一座城市。女神走进贤明的国王阿尔喀
诺俄斯的宫殿，来到国王的女儿瑙西卡的内室。瑙西卡生得美丽、端庄，如同一
个漂亮的女神。她睡在宽敞而又明亮的卧室里，门外有两个侍女看守。雅典娜如
清风似的走到姑娘的床前。她变形为姑娘的侍女，出现在姑娘的梦中，对她说：
" 你这个懒姑娘，你的母亲会笑话你的，你的美丽的衣服还放在橱里没有洗净呢，
如果你明天和人订婚了，你怎么办呢？你将没有一件干净的衣服穿。起来，快去
洗衣服。我陪你去，帮你一起洗，让你尽快把衣服洗完。" 　　姑娘突然醒来，
急忙起了床，走到父母那里。她的母亲正和女仆们坐在炉子前纺织紫线，国王却
在门口遇到了女儿。瑙西卡抓住父亲的手，撒娇地说：" 亲爱的父亲，叫人给我
准备一辆马车吧，让我到河边去洗衣服，我把你和我的兄弟们的衣服都带去洗。

    " 　　姑娘羞于说到自己订婚的事，所以只好这么说。她的父亲知道女儿的
心事，微笑着说：" 去吧，我的孩子，我命仆人为你套车！" 瑙西卡从房里取出
衣服，放在马车上。母亲把甜酒给她装在皮袋内，又给她送上面包和别的食品。
她还给女儿一瓶香膏，让女儿和女仆们沐浴后可以搽抹身体。瑙西卡亲自执缰挥
鞭，架着马车来到河边。她们卸下马，让马儿在草地上吃草，然后拿起衣服在专
供洗衣的小沟里洗濯。沟里注满了河水。姑娘们将衣服搓洗并捶击干净，在清水
里过了一下，然后把衣服一件件晾在被河水冲刷得干干净净的河岸上。洗完衣服，
她们在清水里沐浴，涂上香膏，愉快地吃着带来的食品。大家在草地上尽情地戏
耍，等待衣服在阳光下晒干。　　姑娘们快乐地抛着球，享受着美好的时光。瑙
西卡一边抛球，一边唱歌，大家跟着她一起唱了起来。这时，瑙西卡向她的女伴
掷去一球。隐身在一旁的女神雅典娜把球引向河水的急流中。姑娘们一阵喧闹，
把睡在橄榄树下的奥德修斯惊醒了。他欠起身，心想：我在什么地方？我刚才确
确实实听到了姑娘们欢乐的笑闹声。　　他一边想，一边拉断一根树叶浓密的树
枝，遮盖自己光着的身体，然后从树丛里走出来。他的身上仍然沾着海草和海水
的泡沫，看上去像个野人。姑娘们以为遇上了海怪，吓得四处逃窜。只有阿尔喀
诺俄斯的女儿站立原地，因为雅典娜给了她勇气。　　奥德修斯寻思是上去抱住
姑娘的双膝，还是虔诚地站在远处，恳求她赐给一件衣服，并指点他去寻找人们
居住的地方。想来想去，他觉得还是后一种做法比较合适，于是他在远处对她大
声说：" 喂，我不知道你是女神还是人间女郎，但无论你是谁，我都要向你恳求
援助！

    如果你是女神，那么你一定是阿耳忒弥斯，因为你像她一样端庄美丽。如果
你是人间女郎，那么我要赞美你的父母和兄弟们，因为他们有你这样可爱的女儿
和姐妹，一定很满意。能够娶你为妻的人该有多么幸福啊！请你怜悯我吧，我受
尽了人间少有的折磨。二十天前我离开了俄奇吉亚岛，我被海浪卷入大海。最后
我这个可怜的落难人被冲上了这儿的海岸，我在这里没有一个认识的人。请给我
一件遮身的衣服吧！告诉我，你住在哪座城里？愿神}保佑你万事如意，使你有
一位好丈夫，一个美满的家庭，过上幸福的生活！" 　　瑙西卡回答说：" 外乡
人哪，看上去你像个高尚的人。你既然来到我们的国家，来到我的面前，那么你
就不会缺少衣食。我愿意告诉你我们住在哪里，告诉你关于我们民族的事。居住
在这里的是淮阿喀亚人，我是国王阿尔喀诺俄斯的女儿。" 说完，她唤来逃散的
女仆们，并安慰她们，告诉她们不要害怕这个外乡人。女仆们仍然惊恐地站在那
里。当奥德修斯在隐蔽的小河里冲洗干净后，她们才听从女主人的吩咐，给他送
上长袍和紧身衣。他穿上衣服，正合身。奥德修斯的保护神雅典娜使他显得更加
健美，威武，气宇轩昂，神采奕奕。他从树丛里走出来，坐在略略离开姑娘们的
地方。

    瑙西卡惊讶地打量着眼前这个俊美的男子，对身边的女伴们说：" 一定有个
神}在保护他，并把他带到淮阿喀亚人居住的地方。刚才他又脏又丑，现在却像
自天而降的神}一样。如果我们民族有这样一个出色的人，而且命运之神选他作
我的丈夫，那我多么幸福啊！好了，姑娘们，去吧，给外乡人送上美酒和食品吧！

    " 女伴们立即照她吩咐的做了。奥德修斯又吃又喝，在忍受了长久的饥渴后，
他第一次愉快地享用了一顿美餐。　　现在，他们把晒干的衣服放在马车上。她
们套上马，瑙西卡仍然执着缰绳，她让这个外乡人跟女仆们一起步行跟在后面。
" 这里离城不远，" 她抱歉地对奥德修斯说，" 城池有高高的城墙，只是临海的
一面没有，而是一个宽阔的海港，港湾仅有一条狭条的入口。那里有市场，还有
海神波塞冬的壮丽的神庙，神庙附近是制造、出售缆绳、帆布、桨橹和其它船具
的地方。淮阿喀亚人是勤劳的从事海上作业的民族。现在我们离城不远了，因此
我要避免别人说闲话。在经过市场时，一个遇到我们的农民，会嘲笑地说：' 唷，
瑙西卡身后的那位漂亮的外乡人是谁呀？他大概是瑙西卡的丈夫吧！' 听到这种
闲语，我会十分尴尬的。所以，当我们到了城前那棵献给雅典娜的白杨树圣林时，
请你在那里稍待一会儿。等你估计我们已经进了城，你就赶紧跟上来。你很快会
从许多住房中找到我父亲的宫殿。进了宫殿，你抱住我的母亲的双膝，如果她喜
欢你，那你一定可以得到她的支持和帮助！" 　　瑙西卡说着，缓缓地赶着马车，
使奥德修斯和女仆们可以跟得上。来到雅典娜的圣林时，奥德修斯一人留下，他
虔诚地向他的保护女神雅典娜祈祷，女神听到了他的祈祷

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事5 ：奥德修斯离开卡吕普索，船沉落水

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    宙斯的使者赫耳墨斯奉神}之命从天上飞向海洋，来到俄奇吉亚岛卡吕普索
的住地。赫耳墨斯在这美丽仙女的家里见到她。她马上就认出他是神}的使者。

    但奥德修斯不在那里，他仍像往常一样坐在海边，含泪眺望茫茫的大海，心
中涌起一股怀乡之情。　　卡吕普索的内室布置得非常漂亮。炉子里燃着熊熊的
炉火，檀香木芬芳的青烟在岛上袅袅上升。仙女一面唱着迷人的歌曲，一面用金
梭织着精致的绫罗。她的仙府坐落在白杨和松柏的浓荫中，树上栖息着歌喉宛转、
羽毛美丽的鸟雀，还有雄鹰、乌鸦。葡萄藤攀缠在岩石间，翠绿的枝叶下悬挂着
一串串晶莹的葡萄。有几道山溪流过长满紫堇、香芹和毒草的草地。　　她听到
赫耳墨斯传达了神}的决定后，惊讶得说不出话来。过了一会，她叹息着说："
啊！

    残酷而嫉妒的神}哟！难道你们真的不愿意看到一位天仙许配给一个凡人吗？
是我把他从死亡中救了出来。当时他抱着破船板，随波逐流，一直漂到我的海岛。

    今天，你们却在责怪我为什么把他留下，是吗？他的大船被雷电击中，他的
勇敢的朋友们全都葬身鱼腹了，我以伟大的同情心接纳了这个落难的人，精心调
理他，喂养他，还答应让他永葆青春，与天地同寿。但宙斯的旨意不可违背，那
就只好让他回到海上去漂流吧。你们不要以为我会送他，因为我既没有水手，也
没有船只！我没有礼物送给他，只能给他出个主意，告诉他怎样才能平安地回到
他的家乡。" 　　赫耳墨斯对她的回答很满意，便又回到奥林匹斯圣山。卡吕普
索走到海边，对奥德修斯说：" 可怜的朋友，你不必再忧愁了，我放你回去。你
自己做个小木船！我为你准备一些清水、美酒和食品，还有一些换洗的衣服，并
从岸上给你送上顺风。　　愿神}保佑你平安地回到家乡！" 　　奥德修斯不太
相信地看着女仙说：" 美丽的仙女，恐怕你心里想的又是另外一回事！你只有向
神}发誓，保证不暗害我，我才敢乘小船出海！" 卡吕普索温柔地微笑着说："
你别害怕！大地、天空和地府都可为我作证，我一定不会陷害你！" 说着，她就
转身走了，奥德修斯跟在她后面。卡吕普索回到她的洞府，依依不舍地和奥德修
斯告别。

    不久，小船做成了。第五天，奥德修斯乘着顺风出海了。他坐在船舵旁小心
地掌着舵。一路上，他不敢睡觉，注视着天上的星座，依照卡吕普索在分别时告
诉他的识别标记前进。他在一望无际的大海上平安地航行了十七天。到了第十八
天，他终于看见淮阿喀亚的山影。陆地如同一架盾牌漂浮在昏暗的海面上。

    波塞冬刚从埃塞俄比亚回来，路过索吕默山，突然发现了海上的奥德修斯。
波塞冬没有参加奥林匹斯圣山的神}会议，不知道神}的决定。现在，才知道神
}们乘他不在，强迫女仙释放了奥德修斯。" 好吧，" 波塞冬自言自语地说，"
让他再经历更多的苦难吧！" 于是，他召来了乌云，又挥动三叉戟搅动大海，并
唤来暴风雨，袭击奥德修斯的小船。奥德修斯浑身颤抖，怨恨地说，当初死在特
洛伊人的枪剑下就好了。正在这时，一个巨浪打来，卷没了小船。船舵从他手中
滑落，桅杆和船篷都漂在海上。奥德修斯被卷入波浪，湿透了的衣衫沉甸甸的，
拖着他往下沉。　　他挣扎着浮出水面，连忙吐出了呛进的海水，朝着破碎的小
船游去。

    他费尽气力才抓住小船，随着小船漂流。正在危急之时，海洋女神洛宇科忒
阿看到他。洛宇科忒阿又叫伊诺，是卡德摩斯的女儿。女神非常同情他，从海底
升上来，坐在破碎的小船上对他说：" 奥德修斯，请听我的劝告！快脱去衣服，
离开小船，用我的面纱裹住你的身体，然后朝前游去！" 奥德修斯接过面纱，女
神突然不见了。他虽然不相信她的话，但他仍然听从她的吩咐。他像骑马一样骑
在一块漂浮的木板上，脱去了卡吕普索送给他的衣服，用面纱围在身上，跳进汹
涌的海浪中。　　波塞冬看到这勇敢的人真的跳进海中，不由得摇了摇头说："
好吧，你就在风浪中漂流吧！你得遭受更多更大的痛苦！" 说完，海神波塞冬回
到他的宫殿去。奥德修斯在海上漂了两天两夜，终于他又看见一处满是树的海岸，
波涛冲击着礁石发出阵阵轰鸣。他还来不及考虑，不由自主地被一阵海浪冲上了
海岸。

    他用双手紧紧地抓住一块岩石，可是一个波浪又把他冲回大海。他只得使劲
划动双臂朝前游去。经过一段时间，他漂进了一处浅浅的海湾。这里是一条河流
的入海口。他祈求河神。河神同情他，平息了波浪。奥德修斯终于游到河岸，精
疲力尽地倒在河岸上，口鼻流水，失去了知觉。　　一阵冷风把他吹醒。他从身
上解下面纱，怀着感激的心情把它扔到海里，归还女神。他光着身子，在风中感
到阵阵寒气。他看见附近有座满是树林的小山，于是爬上山去，发现两棵树叶交
错的橄榄树。橄榄树枝叶茂密，能够避风挡雨，还能防止阳光曝晒。他用树叶铺
上一张床，躺了下来，用一些树叶盖在身上。不久，他就沉沉睡去，忘却了一切
磨难。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事4 ：求婚人的阴谋

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    在伊塔刻岛的求婚人依然在奥德修斯的宫殿里大吃大喝。一天，他们中最健
美的欧律玛科斯和安提诺俄斯单独坐在一旁闲谈，这时诺蒙向他们走来，对他们
说：" 你们知道忒勒玛科斯什么时候从皮洛斯回来吗？我借给他一条大船，可我
现在需要用它到厄利斯去。" 　　两个求婚人听到这消息吃了一惊。他们不知道
忒勒玛科斯已经离开了，还以为他隐居到乡下去了。他们再也坐不住了，站起身
来，朝其他的求婚者走去。安提诺俄斯气恼地对他们说：" 我简直不能相信，忒
勒玛科斯真的航海出发了。但愿宙斯让他毁灭，免得他危害我们！朋友们，如果
你们给我找来一艘快船和二十名水手，我愿意在伊塔刻和萨墨岛之间的海峡附近
伏击他，用死亡来结束他的旅行！" 他们都赞成他的主张，答应满足他的要求。

    但是，他们的讲话被侍候他们的使者墨冬听见了，他在心里鄙视这些求婚者。

    现在，他急忙朝珀涅罗珀的房间跑去，向她报告求婚人的阴谋。王后听了，
吃了一惊，呆呆地站在那里，许久不能说话。终于，她说道：" 为什么他一定要
走呢？

    难道他父亲死了还不够吗？难道我们家族的人都得死绝吗？" 墨冬无法对她
解释，只好伏在门槛上哭泣。" 快去把老仆人多利俄斯叫来，让他快去找拉厄耳
忒斯，把这里的情况告诉他。也许老人会想出一个补救的办法！" 珀涅罗珀大声
地吩咐着。这时，老女仆欧律克勒阿走上前来，对她说：" 王后，你把我杀死吧。
这一切我是知道的，我是完全照他的吩咐做的。可是我对他发誓，在他走后十二
天之内不把他航行出海的事告诉你，除非你发觉他不在了。现在我劝你离开这里，
前去请求雅典娜保护你的儿子。" 　　珀涅罗珀听从了她的劝告。当她虔诚地为
儿子的平安祈祷后，她平静地躺下睡了。雅典娜让珀涅罗珀的姐姐，即英雄奥宇
梅洛斯的妻子伊菲提墨和她梦中相会。梦中，伊菲提墨安慰妹妹，请她放心，儿
子一定会回来的。" 别担心，" 她说，" 你的儿子有一位令天下人羡慕的同伴，
帕拉斯。雅典娜跟他在一起保护他。派我到你梦中找你的也是帕拉斯。雅典娜。
" 珀涅罗珀惊醒了，心里很高兴，也增添了新的勇气。她深信，梦中的事完全是
真的。　　求婚人准备好船只。安提诺俄斯率领二十名水手登上了船。在伊塔刻
岛和萨墨岛之间有一座布满暗礁的小岛。安提诺俄斯驾船来到这里，他们潜伏在
海峡口，准备袭击忒勒玛科斯。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事3 ：忒勒玛科斯在斯巴达

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    斯巴达的国王正在宫殿里举行宴会。庆祝两个子女的订婚：一个是海伦的女
儿赫耳弥俄涅许配给阿喀琉斯的儿子涅俄普托勒摩斯，另一个是儿子墨伽彭忒斯
与斯巴达的名门闺女订婚。席间，一名歌手弹着竖琴，两个杂耍艺人正在翻斤斗
逗乐。正在欢闹之际，忒勒玛科斯和珀西斯特拉托斯来到宫门前，一个武士向墨
涅拉俄斯报告，两个外乡人求见。墨涅拉俄斯立即吩咐请他们进来。仆人们出来
卸下跑得大汗淋漓的马匹，把它们牵入马厩，马槽中已放满了燕麦和草料。马车
也被送进了车棚。两个客人被请进华丽的宫殿，并用温水沐浴，洗去了尘埃，恢
复了精神，然后被引见国王。国王请他们坐在他身边的席位上。　　忒勒玛科斯
看到华丽的宫殿和丰盛的食品，很是惊异。他对朋友小声说：" 你看，大厅里这
些金银用具和晶莹的象牙制品，璀灿夺目，真是无价之宝啊！宙斯在奥林匹斯圣
山上的宫殿也不会比它更漂亮！" 忒勒玛科斯尽管说话的声音很低，但墨涅拉俄
斯还是听到了他最后的一句话。" 亲爱的孩子，" 他微笑着说，" 任何凡人都不
该跟宙斯比高低！宙斯的宫殿和他所有的一切都是不朽的！在世间也许只有少数
人比我更富裕，因为我的财富是通过艰难的冒险得来的。我在回国的路上走了整
整八年。我到过塞浦路斯、腓尼基、埃及、埃塞俄比亚和利比亚。朋友们，这是
怎样的国家啊！羊羔生下就有角，绵羊一年生三胎，无论主人和牧人都不缺少肉
食、鲜奶和乳酪。可是，当我在许多国家获得大量财富时，我的兄长却在迈肯尼
被他不忠诚的妻子杀死。我虽有财富，却难得欢乐！不管你们来自何方，你们一
定从你们的父亲那里听说过这些事。如果在特洛伊城前阵亡的英雄们能活到今天，
我即使只有现在三分之一的财产，也感到知足了！当然，我尤其痛惜一个英雄！

    希腊英雄们经历的苦难没有一个超过奥德修斯的。可是我却不知道他现在是
活着还是死了！" 　　墨涅拉俄斯正说着，王后海伦从内室走了出来，美丽得像
女神一样。她坐在丈夫身边，好奇地向他丈夫打听新来的客人的身世。" 这位年
轻人酷似高贵的英雄奥德修斯。" 海伦悄悄地对丈夫说。　　" 我也在这样想呢！
" 她丈夫说，" 他的双手，双脚，眼睛，头发的样子，一切都像奥德修斯。" 珀
西斯特拉托斯听到他们的话，高声地回答说：" 你说得对，墨涅拉俄斯国王，这
位就是奥德修斯的儿子忒勒玛科斯。我的父亲涅斯托耳派我同来，想向你打听关
于奥德修斯的消息。" 　　" 天哪，" 墨涅拉俄斯惊叫起来，" 那么这位客人就
是我的好友的儿子！" 于是，他情不自禁地怀念起他的好友来。　　宴会完毕，
两位客人被安排在宫中就寝。　　第二天早晨，国王又向客人问起奥德修斯在伊
塔刻的家庭情况。当他听说求婚人在那里胡作非为时，他愤怒地说：" 哼，这些
恶棍竟在伟大的奥德修斯的家里作威作福！有朝一日奥德修斯回来，会像雄狮一
样收拾他们的。听我说，我想把海神普洛托斯在埃及对我说的一切告诉你们。那
时候我迫使他预言希腊英雄们在归途中的遭遇和命运。普洛托斯说：' 我凭我的
神眼看到奥德修斯被困在一座荒岛上，流着思乡泪。仙女卡吕普索强行留下了他。

    他既找不到船，也找不到水手把他带回国。' 亲爱的年轻人，这就是我能够
告诉你的有关奥德修斯的全部消息。"

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事2 ：忒勒玛科斯和涅斯托耳

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    忒勒玛科斯来到海边，用海水洗净双手后，就向日前变作人形来看他的神}
祈祷。帕拉斯。雅典娜重新变形为门托尔，走上前来对他说：" 忒勒玛科斯，如
果你还具备你的父亲，睿智的奥德修斯的精神，那么你应立即鼓起勇气去做自己
的决定的事！我是你父亲的老朋友，我将帮你准备一只快船，然后陪你同行！"
忒勒玛科斯连忙回家，准备出发。在途中他遇到年轻的求婚人安提诺俄斯。

    安提诺俄斯握着他的手笑着对他说：" 别再恼恨我们了！你应该像以前一样
跟我们饮宴！让公民们为你去准备旅行的事吧。等他们找来大船和水手，你再驾
船前往皮洛斯也不迟！" 忒勒玛科斯回答说：" 不，安提诺俄斯，我不能再和你
们一起吃喝了！我已经不是孩子了。我已经决定出发了！" 说着，他缩回手走进
父亲的库房。这里堆满了黄金、珠宝，箱子里装满贵重的礼服，还有满罐的香油，
成坛的美酒，应有尽有。他在这里遇到忠实的女仆欧律克勒阿。他进屋后关上门，
对她说：" 请你给我准备十二只双耳大坛的美酒，封好口，再用皮袋装二十石上
等细面粉。天黑前我来取。如果我母亲问起我，十二天后才能告诉她，就说我外
出寻找父亲去了！" 　　这时，雅典娜变形为忒勒玛科斯，亲自招募水手，并向
一位富裕的公民诺蒙借来一艘大船。然后她让求婚人喝得酩酊大醉，连酒杯都从
手里滑落，他们都沉沉睡去。雅典娜又变形为门托尔，来到忒勒玛科斯的面前，
催他出发。两人来到海边，水手们已经到齐。他们动手把一切用品装上船，然后
上船。海风扬满船帆，这时他们浇酒向神}举行祭礼。一整夜船在顺风中航行。

    太阳升起时，涅斯托耳的城市皮洛斯已经出现在他们的眼前。皮洛斯人正在
忙碌地准备给海神献祭。他们宰了九头黑牛，将祭品焚烧，献给海神，同时举行
盛大饮宴。当伊塔刻人登陆时，忒勒玛科斯和变形为门托尔的雅典娜向人群走来。

    涅斯托耳正和他的儿子们坐在人群中，皮洛斯人看到从海岸上走来一群外乡
人，急忙迎上去和他们握手，并请忒勒玛科斯和他的随从在桌前就坐。涅斯托耳
的儿子珀西斯特拉托斯热情地招待他们，请两人坐在席地而铺的厚实的地毯上，
两边是他的父亲和他的兄弟特拉斯墨得斯。然后他挑出最好的牛肉送到他们面前，
给他们斟满酒，请他们干杯。珀西斯特拉托斯对雅典娜变成的老人说：" 外乡人，
快向波塞冬祈祷，向他祭献美酒，让你的朋友也这样做，因为一切凡人都需要神
}的保护！" 雅典娜端起酒杯，请求海神为涅斯托耳和他的子孙，以及皮洛斯人
降福，祈求海神帮助忒勒玛科斯完成他的使命。说着，她把杯中的酒倾洒于地，
同时吩咐奥德修斯的儿子也这样做。　　他们快活地畅饮用餐。年迈的涅斯托耳
看到大家已酒足饭饱，便有礼地询问外乡人的身世和此行的目的。忒勒玛科斯说，
他是奥德修斯的儿子，前来打听父亲的消息。　　老人听说后长叹一声，讲起在
特洛伊战死的英雄以及他们在归途中的经历。但他对奥德修斯的情况知道的并不
比忒勒玛科斯知道的更多。他又讲起阿伽门农之死和俄瑞斯忒斯为父报仇的事。

    最后，他劝忒勒玛科斯到斯巴达去找国王墨涅拉俄斯。墨涅拉俄斯在海上遇
到风暴，被吹到远方的海岸，最近才从那儿回来。也许他知道一些关于奥德修斯
的消息。雅典娜赞同他的建议，并说：" 现在天色已晚，请允许我的年轻的朋友
在你的宫殿里休息。我要回船去照料，并在船上就寝。明天我将乘船去考科涅斯
去取一笔欠债。我请求你备好快马，派你的儿子送我的朋友忒勒玛科斯前往斯巴
达。

    " 涅斯托耳答应了这个要求。　　突然，雅典娜变成一头雄鹰，展翅飞上天
空。

    大家看到天上出现的奇迹，非常惊异。涅斯托耳握着忒勒玛科斯的手说："
亲爱的孩子，你不用悲愁，神}在保护你。雅典娜在你身边。从前，她在所有的
亚各斯人中最喜欢你的父亲！" 说完，老人向女神祈祷，保证在第二天清晨向她
献祭一头小牛。然后，他领着客人回到王宫。　　第二天天刚亮，精力充沛的老
人涅斯托耳就起了床，走到门口，坐在雪白光滑的石凳上，这是放在宫门口专供
休息用的石凳。他的几个儿子都来了，珀西斯特拉托斯把伊塔刻的客人也带来了。
仆人牵来一头母牛，这是涅斯托耳亲口向雅典娜许诺的祭品。金匠拉厄耳克斯被
召来给牛角包金。女仆们忙着准备佳肴，摆桌子，搬木柴，并端上清水，祭礼所
需的一切，都准备齐全。忒勒玛科斯的同伴们也从船上来到宫门口。涅斯托耳的
两个儿子各自握着一只包金的牛角，第三个儿子捧来水盆和祭供的大麦，第四个
儿子手执杀牛的利斧，第五个儿子端上一只大盆，用来接取牛血。　　他们把最
好的牛肉献祭给女神，并洒上甜蜜的美酒。其余的牛肉被穿在铁叉上烧烤。　　
这时，忒勒玛科斯用温水沐浴后，穿上华丽的衣袍，走出来。宴饮时，仆人已经
把马套上车，准备把年轻的客人送往斯巴达。女仆把面包、美酒和其他食品放到
车上。忒勒玛科斯登上马车，坐了下来。珀西斯特拉托斯坐在他的身边，手执缰
绳，挥动马鞭，马匹如飞似地朝前奔去。不一会，皮洛斯城就被远远地抛在后面。

    [ 中文版] 奥德修斯的故事1 ：忒勒玛科斯和求婚人

    古斯塔夫。施瓦布

    注：《奥德修斯的故事》属于施瓦布所著《古希腊神话故事》之第二十七章。

    由刘超之、艾英先生翻译　　特洛伊战争后，那些在战场上和归途中幸免于
难的希腊英雄先后回到故乡。可是，只有拉厄耳忒斯的儿子，伊塔刻国王奥德修
斯没有回来，命运女神又给他安排了一场奇特的遭遇。他久经漂泊后，来到俄奇
吉亚岛。这是一座孤岛，岛上怪石嶙峋，满是参天大树。提坦巨人阿特拉斯的女
儿，女仙卡吕普索，把他抢入山洞，愿意委身于他，作他的丈夫。女仙保证让他
与天地同寿，而且永葆青春。奥德修斯却仍然忠于他的妻子珀涅罗珀。奥德修斯
的忠贞感动了奥林匹斯圣山上的神}，除海神波塞冬外，没有一个不同情他。海
神与他有宿仇，不愿与他和解，但也不敢毁灭他，只是让他在归途中历经磨难，
就是因为这个缘故，他才流落到这座偏僻的荒岛上。　　神}们商议后决定，卡
吕普索必须释放奥德修斯。于是，雅典娜派神}的使者赫耳墨斯来到地上，向这
美丽的女仙传达宙斯的命令。赫耳墨斯强调说，宙斯的决定是不可违抗的。雅典
娜也从奥林匹斯神山降落下来，来到伊塔刻岛。她隐去神}之身，变形为手执长
矛的塔福斯人的国王门忒斯，进入奥德修斯的宫殿。　　奥德修斯的宫中一片悲
哀和混乱。美丽的珀涅罗珀和她的年轻的儿子忒勒玛科斯已不能成为宫殿的主人
了。

    珀涅罗珀是伊卡里俄斯的女儿，他曾宣布把女儿嫁给竞赛的胜利者。奥德修
斯在竞赛中取胜，得到了聪明而美丽的姑娘珀涅罗珀。奥德修斯带着她离开拉西
堤蒙回伊塔刻时，伊卡里俄斯恳求女儿不要离开他。奥德修斯请她自己决定。珀
涅罗珀默默地把新娘的面纱罩住脸，表示愿意随他回去。此后，她一直忠于爱情，
至今不渝。特洛伊城陷落的消息传到伊塔刻时，她看到其他英雄陆续回到家乡，
但不见奥德修斯归来。时间长了，便有人谣传他已死了，后来，越来越多的人信
以为真。于是，珀涅罗珀一下子成了年轻的寡妇，她的美丽和巨大的财富吸引了
众多的求婚者。单从伊塔刻就来了十二个王子，从邻近的萨墨岛来了二十四个，
从查托斯岛来了二十个，而从杜里其翁则来了五十二个。此外，求婚者还带了一
名使者，一名歌手，两个厨子以及一大群随从。所有的王子都来向珀涅罗珀求婚，
并强行住在宫殿里，吃喝玩乐，尽情享用奥德修斯的财富。这种情况已有三年了。

    雅典娜变为门忒斯的样子走进宫殿，看到求婚者正在宫里饮宴作乐。他们坐
在从奥德修斯的仓库里取出的牛皮上，使者和仆人们来回为他们斟酒，分食品，
抹桌子。奥德修斯的儿子忒勒玛科斯悲伤地坐在求婚者中间，思念着父亲，盼望
他早日回来，赶走这群无赖。突然，忒勒玛科斯看到一位陌生的国王走进宫来，
便上去和他握手，热烈地欢迎他。两个人一起走进宫中。雅典娜把长矛放在大柱
旁的枪架上，那里还有奥德修斯的武器。忒勒玛科斯请客人入座。座位上铺着花
纹美丽的软垫。他还把一张小凳拉过来让客人搁脚，然后坐在他身边。一名少女
用金盒盛来热水请他洗手，后来又送来面包、肉和酒。不一会，求婚者也跑过来
坐在餐桌旁，津津有味地大吃大喝。仆人们忙忙碌碌，斟酒送水。求婚者在酒足
饭饱后，要求演奏音乐。使者把精巧的竖琴递给歌手菲弥俄斯，他调好琴弦，演
唱起来。　　求婚者听得兴味正浓，这时，忒勒玛科斯站起身来朝客人鞠了一躬，
然后凑到他的身边，悄悄地说：" 你看到这批人在这里如何挥霍我父亲的财富了
吗？我的父亲也许阵尸异国海边，遭受日晒雨淋；也许在海浪中漂流，并葬身海
底。恐怕他不能回来惩罚他们了。高贵的客人，请告诉我，你是什么人？""我是
门忒斯，" 雅典娜回答说，" 是安喀阿罗斯的儿子，统治着塔福斯海岛。我乘船
去忒墨萨，用铁去交换铜，正好路过这里。你可以去问问你的祖父拉厄耳忒斯，
听说他住在离城很远的乡下，忍受着精神的折磨，他会告诉你，我们两家世代友
好，友谊深远。我到这里来，原以为你的父亲已经回来了。虽然我在这里没有见
到他，但他还活着。他流落到一座荒岛上，被迫停留在那里。我有一种预感，他
在那里不会呆得太久，不久他便会回到故乡。忒勒玛科斯，你不愧是你父亲的儿
子，跟他很像。你也有一双明澈的眼睛。告诉你，我在你的父亲出征特洛伊之前
就认识他，后来我再也没有见过他。当然，我仍然不明白，今天，宫殿里这样热
闹，究竟是怎么回事？你是在宴请客人还是在举办婚礼？" 　　忒勒玛科斯长叹
一声，回答说：" 啊，亲爱的朋友，我的家族过去可以说又显赫又富裕，现在却
完全变样了。邻国来了一大群人，你都看到了，他们来向我的母亲求婚，尽管她
拒绝了，可是却无法赶走他们。他们破坏了宫中的宁静，任意挥霍我俩的财富，
要不了多久，我们就会破产了。" 　　女神听到这里又悲伤又愤怒，她说：" 啊，
你多么需要你的父亲啊！让我告诉你怎样赶走这些人。明天，你起身后就对求婚
者说，让他们都回去。告诉你母亲，如果她想再嫁人，就应该回到她父亲的宫殿
去。他们在那里才可以为她准备嫁妆，举办婚礼。你自己则准备最好的海船，再
挑选二十名水手，尽快出海去寻找父亲。你先到皮洛斯岛，询问德高望重的老人
涅斯托耳。如果他一无所知，那么再去斯巴达寻找英雄墨涅拉俄斯，因为他是希
腊人中最后一个离开特洛伊的。如果你在那里听说你父亲还活着，就在那里待一
年。如果听说他已经死了，你就马上回来，献祭死者并给他建立坟墓。如果求婚
者直到那时仍然呆在你的宫中不离开，你就得用武力或用计谋把他们杀掉。你已
经是成人，不是小孩子了！你难道没有听说过年轻的俄瑞斯忒斯为了替父报仇，
杀掉了凶手埃癸斯托斯，赢得了辉煌的声誉吗？要好自为之，让后辈也赞美你！

    " 　　忒勒玛科斯感谢客人慈父般地对他提出了有益的建议，并在客人动身
时，想送他一件礼物，让他带回去。但化装成门忒斯的女神对他说以后来时再把
礼物带回去。说完话她突然不见了，如同一只小鸟一样飞走了。忒勒玛科斯感到
很惊讶，猜想这是一个神}. 　　在宫殿的大厅里，菲弥俄斯还在弹奏竖琴，如
怨似诉地歌唱希腊英雄在特洛伊战争结束后返回家乡的冒险经历。求婚者听得津
津有味，而珀涅罗珀寂寞地坐在内室，伤心地听着这凄惨的歌声。她禁不住戴上
面纱，带了两个女仆走进大厅里，流着泪对歌手菲弥俄斯说：" 善良的歌手哟，
你会唱许多让人听了快乐的歌。请你另外唱一首吧，别唱这首使我心碎的歌了。
这首歌使我怀念那个驰名全希腊，但仍未归来的英雄！" 　　忒勒玛科斯温和地
对母亲说：" 别责怪歌手了，他可以唱他喜欢唱的歌。奥德修斯不是唯一没有回
到故乡的人，多少希腊英雄在特洛伊城前牺牲了！亲爱的母亲，回到你的房里去
纺纱织布吧。发号施令是男人的事，首先是我的事，因为我是这宫殿的主人。"
　　珀涅罗珀听到儿子果断的话非常吃惊，她觉得他突然长大成人了。珀涅罗珀
回到房里，哭泣着怀念她的丈夫。她离开后，忒勒玛科斯走到那些过分放肆的求
婚者的面前，对他们大声说：" 求婚的朋友们，你们可以高高兴兴地用餐，但是
别这样喧闹，应该安静欣赏歌手的动人的歌声。明天我将召开国民大会。我要求
你们各自回家，因为你们都必须关心自己的家财，不应该总是挥霍别人的遗产！
如要求婚，请到我的外祖父家里去。" 　　求婚者听到他果断的话，都恨得咬牙
切齿。

    他们坚决不愿意到他的外祖父，即伊卡里俄斯的家里去向他的母亲求婚。最
后，他们一哄而散，回房就寝。忒勒玛科斯也回到卧室休息。第二天清晨，忒勒
玛科斯起了床，穿上礼服，佩上剑，走出屋子，传令召开国民大会。求婚者也被
邀请出席。等人到齐后，国王的儿子执矛来到全场。帕拉斯。雅典娜使他变得更
加高大和庄重，与会人见了都暗暗惊奇和赞叹，连老人都恭敬地给他让路。他坐
在父亲奥德修斯的座位上。首先站起身发言的是弓着腰的老英雄埃古普提俄斯。
他的大儿子安提福斯跟随奥德修斯远征特洛伊，在归国途中在海里溺死。他的第
二个儿子欧律诺摩斯，也是求婚者之一。他还有两个小儿子，和他住在一起。埃
古普提俄斯在会上说：" 自从奥德修斯出征后，我们就没有开过会。今天是谁突
然想起召集我们来开会呢？为什么开会呢？难道是敌人侵犯国境了吗？或者是为
了利国利民的事情？不管怎样，我相信，召集会议的人一定是个正直的人，他的
用意是好的。愿宙斯给他赐福。" 　　忒勒玛科斯从这些话中看出了吉兆，很是
高兴，他从座位上站起来，握着他父亲的王杖到会场中间，看着年迈的埃古普提
俄斯说：" 尊敬的老人，召集你们来开会的人正是我。我很忧伤，很烦恼。首先，
我失去了杰出的亲爱的父亲。现在，我们的家室面临着灾难，家产即将被消耗一
空。

    我的母亲珀涅罗珀为不受欢迎的求婚者所困扰，他们又不愿接受我的建议，
到我外祖父伊卡里俄斯家去向我的母亲求婚。他们天天在我家里宰猪杀羊，畅饮
我们储存的美酒。他们有这么多人，我怎么对付得了？你们这些求婚者，你们难
道不知道你们是无理的？你们不怕遭到神}的报复吗？难道我的父亲得罪过你们？
难道我使你们遭受损失，你们非要我补偿不可？" 　　说着，忒勒玛科斯把王杖
仍在地上。求婚者都默默地听着。除了奥宇弗忒斯的儿子安提诺俄斯外，没有人
敢说话。他站起来说：" 无礼的小孩子，你竟敢辱骂我们！这不是我们求婚者的
过错，而是你母亲的过错。三年过去了，不，第四年也快过去了，可是她仍然在
戏弄我们阿开亚人的感情。她对每个人都口头应允，一会儿对这个人表示有意，
一会儿对那个人表示好感，但她心里又完全是另一回事。我们看穿了她的诡计。
她在房里支起一架织布机，对求婚者说：' 年轻人，你们必须等待，必须等我为
拉厄耳忒斯织好这段寿布，他是我的丈夫的父亲。我不能让希腊的女人指责我，
说我没有给显赫而又年迈的人穿一件体面的寿衣！' 她以这个借口应付我们，博
得了我们的理解和同情。后来，她也真的在白天坐在织布机前织布。可是，到了
夜里，她又在烛光下把白天织过的布拆掉。她就这样蒙骗我们，让我们白白等了
三年。后来，她的一个女仆把消息偷偷地告诉了我们，我们乘她在夜里拆布时闯
了进去，戳穿了她的把戏，并强迫她织完那段布。忒勒玛科斯，我们当然理解你
的要求，你也可以把你的母亲送到她的父亲那里去。可是你必须明确地告诉她，
如果她的父亲为她选中一个合适的求婚者，或者她已经看中一个求婚者，她就必
须和他结婚。如果她继续戏弄我们这些高贵的希腊人，继续玩弄骗人的织布把戏，
我们便要继续住在你的宫殿里吃喝，直到你的母亲选定我们中的一个人为止。否
则，我们是不会回家的。" 　　忒勒玛科斯回答说：" 安提诺俄斯，不管我的父
亲是否还活在世上，我都不能把生育我的母亲赶出家门。无论是她的父亲伊卡里
俄斯还是天上的神}都不会赞成这样做。如果你们还有一点点公正和廉耻心的话，
就请你们用自己的家财去欢宴吧。如果你们愿意无代价地消耗一个显赫男子的遗
产，那也请自便吧！我会祈求宙斯和别的神}帮助我，使你们如数赔偿！" 正当
忒勒玛科斯说话的时候，宙斯在天上向他显示了一种预兆：两头雄鹰展翅从山上
飞起，它们飞到会场上空，威胁似地在天空盘旋。突然，它们俯冲下来，用利爪
抓彼此的头颈。最后，它们又冲上蓝天，在伊塔刻城的上空飞翔。善于用鸟儿占
卜的老人哈利忒耳塞斯解释说，它表示求婚者即将毁灭，因为奥德修斯还活在人
间，他快回来了。求婚人波吕波斯的儿子欧律玛科斯听了不以为然，嘲弄地说：
" 饶舌的老东西，你还是回去给你的儿子去占卜吧！你的预言吓不了我们。

    天上飞着许多鸟儿，可是它们并不全都预示人间的祸福！至于奥德修斯，他
肯定死在异乡了！" 别的求婚人也赞同他的看法，并要求忒勒玛科斯的母亲离开
宫殿，回到她的父亲伊卡里俄斯的家里去，在那里挑选她的丈夫。　　忒勒玛科
斯不想再说服他们，他请伊塔刻人为他挑选二十个水手，预备一艘快船，因为他
要到皮洛斯和斯巴达打听父亲的消息。他告诉大家，如果父亲还活着，忒勒玛科
斯将在宫中再等待一年；如果父亲死了，他将劝他的母亲改嫁。这时奥德修斯的
老朋友门托尔，这是奥德修斯出征特洛伊前委托他管理宫中事务的人，站起来愤
怒地对求婚者说：" 如果一个国王忘记了公正和道义，并且虐待他的人民，毫无
疑问，他将会受到人民的唾弃。你们中间还有谁记得和善而又仁慈的奥德修斯呢？
这些求婚人大肆消耗他的财产，然而在座的人却听任他们胡作非为！我并不抱怨
他们，因为他们听信谣传，以为奥德修斯永远不会回来了。然而那些沉默着对求
婚人不加制止的多数人，我却要责备他们。" 　　可是，厚颜无耻的求婚人雷奥
克律托斯嘲笑门托尔说：" 你就静静地等待奥德修斯回来吧。我们倒要看看，他
回来时看到我们在用膳，是否会跟我们动武？请相信我，珀涅罗珀虽然盼望他归
来，可是，当他真的回来时，珀涅罗珀不一定会感到特别高兴。他会马上碰到恶
运的！

    好了，男子汉们，我们散会吧！让门托尔和鸟儿占卜家哈利忒耳塞斯去为忒
勒玛科斯准备行装吧。我们要打赌吗？过不了几个星期，他又会回来跟我们坐在
一起，等待他父亲的消息。" 　　于是，他们喧闹着散去。国民大会也结束了，
没有作出任何决议。求婚者各自回屋，又在奥德修斯的宫殿里快快活活地大吃大
喝，逍遥自在。
